# Changelog

All notable changes to MIE-Decoder are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versioning model: **v1.0.0 is a joint cut** — both the Rust crate and
the Python package ship from a single repository tag (`v1.0.0`).
Subsequent releases may diverge in version via impl-prefixed tags
(`rust-vX.Y.Z`, `python-vX.Y.Z`); the cross-implementation conformance
contract (byte-exact CSV equivalence on shared behavior) holds at any
compatible version pair. See `docs/MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md` §11 for the
full release workflow.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- Added a Production-Readiness Audit backlog (`PRA-1`–`PRA-9`) to
  `docs/ROADMAP.md`, capturing findings from a comment/docs hygiene sweep
  and a requirements deep analysis: CLI exit-code taxonomy alignment (open
  decision), the unimplemented `L2-DEC-013` forced-format validation,
  trace-matrix L1-marker coverage, Python large-file memory limits and
  `PY-streaming`, a fuzz CI burn-in plus the `L1-SYN-002` cumulative-scan
  test, normative-doc/source-comment staleness, and lower-priority
  test/diagnostic items. Items are unscheduled — no target version is
  assigned until each is planned for closure.
- Removed the stale "v2 redesign" version anchor from the `src/cli.rs` and
  `src/filter.rs` module docs — the described CLI surface is the current
  stable one, not a future redesign (ROADMAP PRA-7, partial).

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-14

Joint Rust + Python maintenance release: close the CI dev-tool gap, tighten
the coverage gates, and clear stale comments. No public API or decode-output
changes. Both implementations ship together from the `v1.4.1` repository tag.

### Added

- A `mypy` CI job and dev dependency. `python/pyproject.toml` declared
  `[tool.mypy] strict = true` but nothing installed or ran it; strict
  type-checking is now gated in CI (`poetry run mypy src`).

### Fixed

- Latent crash in the Python filter: `apply_filters` dereferenced
  `command_word.rt` / `.subaddress` on records with no Command Word
  (SPURIOUS_DATA), raising `AttributeError` whenever such a record reached
  the filter. RT/subaddress filters now treat a missing Command Word as
  "no match" (excludable only by type or bus), matching the Rust filter.
  Surfaced by the new strict mypy gate.

### Changed

- Coverage gates ratcheted from baseline-5pp to baseline-2pp: Rust
  `cov-ci` to 84% line / 83% region (from 70/70), Python `fail_under` to
  88% combined line+branch (from 85%, now config-driven in
  `[tool.coverage.report]`).
- mypy-strict cleanups across the Python package: a shared `ByteSource`
  buffer alias for the `mmap`-backed decode/sync helpers, an explicit
  `TextIO` stream type in `dump`, removal of stale `# type: ignore`
  comments, and minor annotation fixes. No runtime behavior change.

### Removed

- Stale "Deferred (Phase 7b)" comments in `decode.rs` / `decode.py` (the
  RT-to-RT Cmd2-direction and anomaly invariants shipped as
  L2-SYN-023/024/025) and a stale SPURIOUS_DATA "raises ValueError"
  docstring (0x20 classifies as `SPURIOUS_DATA`).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-14

Joint Rust + Python feature release. Adds opt-in **Standard-timestamp
tick calibration**: when an operator supplies the card's free-running
counter frequency, Standard-format records are converted to microseconds
and participate in `DELTA` tracking like IRIG records. Without a rate,
behavior is unchanged (empty `DELTA`), so all existing CSV output stays
byte-identical. Both implementations ship together from the `v1.4.0`
repository tag.

### Added

- New `decode.standard_tick_rate_hz` TOML key and `--standard-tick-rate-hz`
  CLI flag (both implementations). When set to a finite value `> 0`,
  Standard timestamps convert to microseconds as
  `round(raw_ticks × 1_000_000 / rate)` (half-away-from-zero, identical
  across implementations) and join per-RT/MSG `DELTA` tracking
  (L2-DEC-017, L2-CFG-011, L2-CLI-012).
- Float value support in the Rust hand-rolled TOML parser (`TomlValue::Float`,
  `TomlDoc::get_float`), required by the new key. No new crate dependency.
- Two cross-implementation conformance cases — `standard-tick-calibrated-cli`
  and `standard-tick-calibrated-toml` — sharing one oracle to prove the CLI
  and TOML paths produce byte-identical calibrated output.

### Changed

- L2-RDR-019 generalized: Standard-format records have an empty `DELTA`
  only when no tick rate is configured; with a valid rate they participate
  in `DELTA` on the same terms as IRIG. `Timestamp::to_microseconds` /
  `Timestamp.to_microseconds` now take an optional Standard tick rate.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-11

Joint Rust + Python hardening release. Adds precise sync-validation
failure APIs and strict-mode diagnostics, bounded DEBUG context logging,
production Rust unwrap/expect linting, Rust LCOV artifact publishing,
and complete verification coverage for all 131 active requirements.
Both implementations ship together from the `v1.3.0` repository tag.

### Added

- Additive detailed sync-validation APIs in both implementations:
  Rust `sync::validate_record_detailed(...) -> Result<(), ValidationFailure>`
  and Python `sync.validate_record_detailed(...) -> ValidationFailure | None`.
  Existing boolean `validate_record(...)` APIs remain unchanged.
- DEBUG-level validation context diagnostics capped at 32 bytes in both
  readers.
- Rust CI now uploads `lcov.info` as the `rust-lcov` workflow artifact.

### Changed

- Strict-mode IRIG-range and look-ahead failures now name the precise
  validation reason instead of the combined "IRIG-range or look-ahead"
  fallback detail.
- Rust production crates enable Clippy's `unwrap_used` and `expect_used`
  lints outside test builds; former production unwrap/expect sites now
  return defensive errors.
- Rust CLI acceptance coverage now pins both `--inline-errors` and the
  stdout-forces-inline behavior required by L3-RS-009.

### Removed

- Python's unconditional multi-line unknown-Type-Word stderr dump. The
  bounded DEBUG context diagnostic replaces it and respects log-level
  configuration.

### Maintenance

- Close the remaining partial traceability row with an L2-CONF-002
  conformance-runner wiring inspection test. All 131 active requirements
  are now verified.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-08

Configurable sync look-ahead with TOML + CLI controls, a Python
TOML `[logging] level` precedence fix, the new Python coverage
gate in CI (85% combined line+branch floor mirroring the Rust
70/70 model), retirement of the static-musl SLES 12 deployment
target, retirement of the `docs/FIELDS.md` redirect stub, and
three new cross-impl conformance fixtures (L2-DEC-015 borderline,
L2-DEC-016 lenient-mode WARN, L2-SYN-026 N>2 catches what N=2
misses). Both implementations ship together at v1.2.0 from a
single repository tag (`v1.2.0`), continuing the joint-cut model
established by v1.0.0.

### Added

- **Configurable N-record sync look-ahead** (L2-SYN-005, L2-SYN-026).
  `sync::validate_record` (Rust) / `sync.validate_record` (Python) now
  accept a look-ahead depth parameter `N`. The function checks `N − 1`
  subsequent records' Type Words after the candidate, advancing by each
  record's declared `word_count`. Default `N = 2` preserves the
  historical two-record look-ahead behavior; higher values catch wider
  classes of consecutive-same-shape corruption that previously defeated
  the validator (e.g., two adjacent fake-record headers that align on
  plausible Type Words). Configurable via `decode.lookahead_records` in
  TOML or `--lookahead-records N` on the CLI, range `[1, 32]`. See
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 Phase 3 for the design.
- New TOML key `decode.lookahead_records` with load-time range
  validation.
- New CLI flag `--lookahead-records N` with parse-time range
  validation, exposed in both the Rust and Python CLIs.
- **Python coverage gate in CI** (`python-coverage` job). Mirrors
  the Rust `cargo cov-ci` model: runs once on Linux/Python 3.12,
  not across the full matrix (coverage isn't platform- or
  interpreter-dependent). `pytest-cov ^7.0` added as a dev
  dependency; `[tool.coverage.run]` and `[tool.coverage.report]`
  sections added to `python/pyproject.toml` (branch coverage on,
  `__main__.py` excluded as the entry shim — parallel to Rust's
  `bin/mie-decoder.rs` exclusion). Floor is **85% combined
  line+branch**, set as `--cov-fail-under=85` in the CI job.
  Baseline at integration was 88.92% across the 245-case pytest
  suite, giving ~4 percentage points of headroom before drift
  starts failing the build (same ratchet model as the Rust 70/70
  floor's ~5pp headroom against its 74.81% baseline).
  `docs/MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md` §10 rewritten to cover both Rust and
  Python coverage workflows; cheat sheet (§3) gains the
  `poetry -C python run pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=85`
  invocation alongside `cargo cov-ci`; CI architecture table (§9)
  updated from five jobs to six.
- **Conformance fixture: L2-DEC-015 borderline detection** (two
  cases). `timestamp-format-borderline-default` and
  `timestamp-format-borderline-n1` share a hand-crafted 5-record
  input where the multi-record probe genuinely changes the format
  choice cross-impl: at `--detect-records 1` both impls pick
  Standard and decode 1 row; at default `--detect-records 8` both
  impls pick IRIG (Decisive) and decode 4 rows. The two oracles
  are byte-identical across Rust and Python, pinning the cross-
  impl behavior at each N.
- **Conformance fixture: L2-DEC-016 lenient-mode WARN**
  (`timestamp-format-ambiguous-lenient`). Reuses the (now-fixed)
  ambiguous input bytes with default (lenient) mode. Asserts
  exit 0 with a header-only CSV oracle, plus a stderr substring
  assertion that pins the lenient-mode WARN's score breakdown
  (`"Ambiguous: IRIG=4 STD=4"`). Companion to the strict
  fixture; together they pin both branches of L2-DEC-016
  cross-impl.
- **Stderr substring assertions on both L2-DEC-016 conformance
  fixtures.** Strict fixture now asserts
  `expected_stderr_contains: "auto-detection is ambiguous"`
  (substring unique to the `MieTimestampFormatMismatch` error
  message); lenient asserts the WARN substring as above. These
  defend against future regressions that exit with the right code
  via the wrong code path — the same class of bug-in-test the
  strict fixture had until v1.2.0's strict-fixture fix.
- **Conformance fixture: L2-SYN-026 N-record look-ahead value
  demonstration** (two cases). `lookahead-corruption-chain-n2`
  and `lookahead-corruption-chain-n4` share a hand-crafted
  5-record input (2 valid records, 32 bytes of 0xFF garbage, 1
  valid record at the end). At `--lookahead-records 2` both
  impls accept the file start, decode record 1, then sync-
  recover through the garbage and decode record 5 — 2 rows. At
  `--lookahead-records 4` both impls reject the file start
  (look-ahead chain reaches the garbage), scan forward, and
  accept only record 5 — 1 row. The contrast (2 rows vs 1 row)
  demonstrates the L2-SYN-026 value proposition: deeper look-
  ahead catches "valid prefix followed by corruption" patterns
  that defeat the default N=2 window. Both oracles byte-
  identical cross-impl.

Total conformance case count: 21 → 27 across this release.
Python test count: 242 → 248.

### Changed

- `docs/L2-REQ.md` L2-SYN-005 generalized in place: the original
  "two-record look-ahead" wording is now described as a special
  case of the configurable N-record rule with default `N = 2`.
  The generalization is non-breaking (existing files and configs
  continue to behave identically); the rationale for the
  in-place wording update is recorded in the L2-SYN-005
  Rationale field.

### Removed

- **Static-musl SLES 12 deployment target.** The Rust crate is
  no longer published with documentation or tooling for the
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` cross-compile path. Native release
  builds (`cargo build --release`) are now the only documented
  artifact; deployers targeting older glibc hosts produce the
  static binary themselves out-of-tree if needed. Concrete
  changes: `docs/L3-REQ.md` L3-RS-007 marked *Withdrawn in
  v1.2.0* (the ID is reserved, not reused, so the trace matrix
  and historical references stay coherent); `README.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md`,
  `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`, `docs/L1-REQ.md` rationale, and
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` comments updated to remove musl /
  SLES references; historical CHANGELOG and ROADMAP entries
  describing the v1.0.0 musl scope preserved as-is. Trace matrix
  regenerated (active L3 count: 26 → 25; L3-RS subtotal:
  12 → 11).
- **`docs/FIELDS.md`** — the 3-line redirect stub kept for
  legacy external-link compatibility since the L2-DEC-015 /
  Documentation Initiative absorbed its content into
  `docs/MIE-FORMAT.md`. The stub has done its job; deleted. All
  active references repointed at `docs/MIE-FORMAT.md` directly
  or removed: `docs/L1-REQ.md` (L1-OUT-001), `docs/L2-REQ.md`
  (L2-DEC-002, L2-SYN-025 rationale, error-code family
  rationale) — repointed; `docs/MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md` (repo-tree
  listing), `CLAUDE.md` (Reference docs section), `README.md`
  (repo-tree listing) — stub row dropped; `docs/MIE-FORMAT.md` —
  the "absorbs FIELDS.md" note removed entirely and replaced
  with a direct "single source of truth" statement (no
  historical breadcrumb to the deleted predecessor). ROADMAP
  historical mentions of FIELDS.md (Documentation Initiative
  recap, deferred-audit notes, etc.) preserved as-is since they
  describe past state accurately.

### Fixed

- **Python: `[logging] level` in TOML config now honored**
  (regression of L2-CFG-003 precedence: CLI > TOML > default).
  `python/src/mie_decoder/config.py` was parsing
  `[logging] level` into `DecoderConfig.log_level` and
  validating it at load time, but `python/src/mie_decoder/cli.py`
  only called `configure_logging()` once at the top of `main()`
  with the CLI value (or `"WARNING"` default) — `_run_decode`
  then loaded the TOML but never re-applied the log level. Net
  effect: a TOML `[logging] level = "INFO"` was silently ignored
  unless the user also passed `--log-level` on the CLI. Rust
  applied the TOML value correctly via `resolve_config` in
  `src/cli.rs`. Fix introduces a small
  `_apply_config_log_level(args, config_log_level)` helper called
  immediately after `load_config(...)` in both `_run_decode` and
  `_run_dump`; it re-configures the logger from the TOML value
  when `--log-level` was not passed. The CLI value (when present)
  still wins because `main()` configured with it before the
  subcommand runner was entered. Also adds `--config` to the
  `dump` subparser so `mie-decoder dump file.mie --config
  foo.toml` can honor the TOML log level too (mirrors Rust, where
  `--config` is a global flag accepted by every subcommand). New
  Python e2e regressions in `python/tests/test_e2e.py`:
  `test_cli_toml_logging_level_is_honored_when_no_cli_override`
  (catches the original bug — fails without the fix),
  `test_cli_log_level_overrides_toml_logging_level` (pins the
  CLI-wins precedence), and
  `test_cli_dump_honors_toml_logging_level` (covers the
  dump-path fix). New cross-impl conformance fixture
  `log-level-from-toml-config` reuses the `basic-multi-record`
  input + oracle plus `configs/log-level-info.toml` and asserts
  the substring `"decode exit class"` appears on stderr — an
  INFO-level message both impls emit identically.
- **Conformance fixture `timestamp-format-ambiguous-strict` was
  exercising the wrong code path.** Discovered while adding the
  lenient-mode companion fixture. The fixture's input bytes had
  a Type Word declaring `word_count = 7` (14 bytes) but the
  actual hex block contained 16 bytes per record. The mismatch
  caused `find_first_record`'s look-ahead to land on filler
  bytes mid-record and reject the candidate, producing
  `MieNoValidRecords` (exit 2) instead of the intended
  `MieTimestampFormatMismatch` (also exit 2). The strict
  fixture's `expected_exit: 2` couldn't distinguish the two
  error paths, so the test passed for the wrong reason. Fix:
  change the Type Word's `word_count` field from 7 to 8 so the
  declared length matches the actual 16-byte record. The probe
  now reaches AMBIGUOUS classification correctly, and the
  strict fixture exercises the L2-DEC-016 path it was always
  meant to.

### Maintenance

- `docs/diagrams/dataflow.puml` `find_first_record` note
  updated: "(two-record look-ahead)" → "(L2-SYN-005 /
  L2-SYN-026; N defaults to 2, configurable via
  decode.lookahead_records)". The rendered
  `docs/diagrams/dataflow.svg` was regenerated to match
  (PlantUML 1.2026.5, matching the pin in the `diagrams` CI
  job).
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` refreshed for v1.2.0: v1.1.0 release-status
  entry added; "Queued for the next release" rewritten to
  summarize the full `[Unreleased]` contents (L2-SYN-026
  configurable look-ahead, FIELDS.md retirement, Python coverage
  gate, Python TOML log-level fix, three new cross-impl
  conformance fixtures, dataflow-diagram refresh); the two
  Robustness-backlog items resolved in v1.1.0 / v1.2.0 are
  struck through with their resolution commits; "Shared
  Commitments" text updated from "two-record look-ahead" to the
  N-record wording. A mid-cycle "Deferred follow-ups" section
  introduced during v1.2.0 development was removed before the
  release cut — every item it tracked shipped within v1.2.0.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-07

Stronger timestamp-format auto-detection via a multi-record probe,
plus a new ambiguous-detection error class. Both implementations
ship together at v1.1.0 from a single repository tag (`v1.1.0`),
continuing the joint-cut model established by v1.0.0.

### Added

- **Multi-record timestamp-format auto-detection** (L2-DEC-015). The
  IRIG-vs-Standard probe now walks up to *N* records (default `8`,
  configurable via `decode.detect_records` in TOML or `--detect-records N`
  on the CLI, range `1..=32`) and aggregates per-record scoring across the
  probe set rather than committing on the first record alone. The chosen
  format is still resolved before the first record is decoded and is final
  for the rest of the decode per L2-DEC-011 (no per-record re-detection).
  Strengthens detection on borderline files where the first record alone
  scores ambiguously between the two formats. See
  `docs/MIE-FORMAT.md` §5.3 for the per-record scoring signals and
  confidence thresholds.
- **`MieTimestampFormatMismatchError`** / `MieError::TimestampFormatMismatch`
  (L2-DEC-016). New file-level error variant raised when the L2-DEC-015
  probe completes with an aggregate score below the confidence floor
  (`max_score < 4`) OR a margin below `MIN_MARGIN = 3`. Strict mode only:
  lenient mode (the default) logs a single WARN with the score breakdown
  and proceeds with the chosen format, preserving backwards compatibility
  with borderline files that decoded acceptably under the previous
  single-record detection. Maps to CLI exit class `2` (`no-records`),
  same class as `NoValidRecords` and `HomogeneousPayload`.
- New TOML key `decode.detect_records` with load-time range validation.
- New CLI flag `--detect-records N` with parse-time range validation.

### Changed

- Auto-detection logs now include the per-format aggregated score
  breakdown plus the L2-DEC-016 confidence classification:
  - `Decisive` and `Marginal` outcomes log at INFO with score numbers
    plus a hint to `--time-format` on Marginal calls.
  - `Ambiguous` outcomes log at WARN (lenient) or ERROR + raise (strict).
- Conformance manifest schema validation in `tests/conformance/run.py` now
  checks field types in addition to field names. Rejects wrong scalar types
  (e.g. `"config": 12345`), wrong container types (e.g. `"rust_args": "a
  string"`), wrong list-element types (e.g. `"rust_args": [42]`), and invalid
  enum values (e.g. `"mode": "banana"`) with actionable error messages that
  name the offending field and the expected type.

### Fixed

- `tests/cli.rs::decode_emits_exit_class_summary_at_info_level` now surfaces
  in `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`. The L1 section of the matrix displays only L2
  children and rolled-up status, not direct L1 test markers, so the test's
  `L1-EXIT-005` tag alone was invisible. Added `L2-CLI-006` (stderr-only
  diagnostic obligation) to the `/// Requirements:` line — semantically
  correct (the summary line IS a human-readable stderr diagnostic) and the
  test now shows up under that L2's row.

### Maintenance

- `docs/MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md` §10 "220+ tests" updated to the actual count
  (236 as of v1.0.0).
- Spec additions: `L2-DEC-015` (multi-record probe) and `L2-DEC-016`
  (ambiguous-mismatch error class), both children of `L1-DEC-002`. See
  `docs/L2-REQ.md`.
- New conformance case `timestamp-format-ambiguous-strict` pins the
  cross-impl behavior on strict-mode ambiguous input: both Rust and
  Python raise their respective mismatch errors and exit `2` byte-for-byte
  equivalently. Conformance case count: 20 → 21.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-07

First joint release of the Rust crate and the Python package.
Both implementations ship from the same commit at v1.0.0.

### Highlights

- **Two implementations, one binary contract.** Rust crate at the
  repository root; Python package under `python/`. A 20-case
  conformance suite (`tests/conformance/`) holds the two to byte-exact
  CSV output (and matching exit code on negative cases).
- **DDC-vendor-compatible CSV.** Column names and ordering match DDC's
  own recording software output by spec (`L1-OUT-001`). See
  `docs/VENDOR-CSV-DIFFS.md` for the alignment statement and the five
  vendor-empty columns preserved as placeholders.
- **Streaming Rust writer (constant memory).** The Rust crate streams
  rows directly to a `BufWriter` — `O(1)` per record. Python remains
  pandas-buffered (`O(record_count)` memory) per `L3-PY-012`; a future
  Python-streaming feature is on the roadmap.
- **Static-musl Rust binary for SLES 12 deployment** via
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`. Single self-contained binary, no glibc
  dependency.
- **Single external Rust dependency** (`memmap2`). Argument parsing,
  CSV writing, TOML loading, logging, and error types are all
  hand-rolled — see `CLAUDE.md` "Conventions worth preserving".

### Added — CLI

- `decode`, `count`, `dump` subcommands (Rust); `decode` with
  `--count` / `--dump` flags (Python). CLI shapes intentionally
  differ between impls per `L1-CLI-001` (capability parity, not
  exact spelling). See `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`.
- **Two-channel `count` output** (`L3-RS-008` / `L3-PY-010`): only
  the integer record count goes to stdout (pipeline-friendly:
  `n=$(mie-decoder count rec.mie)`); a human-readable
  `counted <N> messages in <basename>` status line goes to stderr.
- **Output safety subsystem** (`L1-OUT-002`):
  - `--no-clobber` refuses to overwrite an existing output
    (`L2-WRT-014`, `MieClobberRefusedError` / exit 1).
  - Input-equals-output rejection (`L2-WRT-016`,
    `MieInputOutputCollisionError` / exit 1).
  - Atomic write via `<stem>.<pid>.tmp` + `rename` (`L2-WRT-017`).
  - `--allow-partial` commits a partial decode to
    `<stem>.partial.csv` on unrecoverable sync loss (`L2-WRT-015`,
    exit 0); without it the partial is unlinked and the run exits 3.
- **Include filters** (`--include-types` / `--include-rts` /
  `--include-buses` / `--include-subaddresses`) as a Rust-only
  axis (`L3-RS-010`); exclude filters parity across both impls.
- **Exit-class taxonomy** (`L1-EXIT-005`): every decode emits a
  `decode exit class: <class>` INFO summary line and exits 0 / 1 /
  2 / 3 per `L1-EXIT-002`..`L1-EXIT-004`.
- **Inline error output mode** (`L2-ERR-011`): `--inline-errors`
  (Rust) / `--error-mode inline` (Python) keeps errored records
  in the main CSV with `ERROR` and `ERROR_CODE` columns populated
  rather than splitting them to `<stem>_errors.csv`.
- Hand-rolled **TOML config loader** with documented precedence
  (CLI flags > config file > built-in defaults); unknown-key
  warnings (`L2-CFG-009`); load-time validation (`L2-CFG-010`).
  See `docs/CONFIG-REFERENCE.md`.

### Added — decode pipeline

- **Four-phase sync strategy** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3): header
  detection with diagnostic-rich failure (`diagnose_header_scan_failure`
  distinguishes `NoValidRecords` / `FirstRecordTruncated` /
  `HomogeneousPayload`), continuous per-record validation, two-record
  look-ahead confirmation, recovery scan with `MAX_SCAN_BYTES = 64 KB`.
- **Homogeneity-payload defense** (`L2-SYN-018`): rejects pathological
  inputs (all-zero, all-`0xFFFF`, etc.) that would otherwise pass shape
  validation. Maps to exit class 2.
- **First-record-truncated detection** (`L2-RDR-004`,
  `MieFirstRecordTruncatedError`): distinguishes a truncated initial
  record from a generic no-records error.
- **Structural invariants subsystem** (`L2-SYN-020`..`L2-SYN-025`):
  six rules check decoded records against MIL-STD-1553 transaction
  shape. Severity::Reject raises `MieRecordError`; Severity::AnomalyWarn
  logs and keeps the record. Errored records skip invariant checks
  (truncated payload by definition).
- **DELTA tracker** (`L2-RDR-016`..`L2-RDR-019`): per-RT/MSG key
  monotonicity tracking with non-monotonic-timestamp warnings.
- **Error pipeline**: DDC `0x01xx` hardware codes preserved verbatim;
  decoder-internal `0x20xx` codes (`0x2000` SPURIOUS_DATA continuation,
  `0x2001` standalone) assigned by classifying SPURIOUS_DATA records
  against the preceding record state. See `docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md`.

### Added — requirements traceability

- **L1 / L2 / L3 requirements docs** (`docs/L1-REQ.md`,
  `docs/L2-REQ.md`, `docs/L3-REQ.md`): 24 system requirements + 102
  architectural derivations + 26 implementation obligations,
  cross-linked by parent IDs and verification methods.
- **Auto-generated trace matrix** (`docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`) produced by
  `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py`, gated in CI on every push.
- **Per-test requirement tagging** via `/// Requirements:` doc
  comments (Rust) and `@pytest.mark.requirement` markers (Python).

### Added — tooling

- **Cross-platform CI matrix** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Rust on
  `ubuntu-latest` + `windows-latest`; Python on `ubuntu-latest`
  (3.10..3.14) + `windows-latest` (3.12, 3.14); conformance on both
  platforms; trace-matrix `--check`; PlantUML diagram drift gate.
- **`cargo-llvm-cov` coverage gate** at 70% line + region (Rust,
  Linux-only).
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`, installed via
  `bash scripts/install-hooks.sh`) mirroring the CI gates locally:
  whitespace/CRLF/merge-marker scans, file size cap, Cargo.lock
  parity, trace-matrix `--check`, `cargo fmt --check`, clippy,
  `cargo test --all-targets`, `dbg!()` scan, `// SAFETY:` comment
  requirement.
- **Conformance manifest schema enforcement**: typos in case fields
  (e.g. `rust_arg` for `rust_args`) fail fast with an actionable
  error and the list of allowed fields.

### Documentation

- `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` — end-to-end CLI walkthrough.
- `docs/EXAMPLES.md` — 11 runnable operator-task recipes.
- `docs/MIE-FORMAT.md` — comprehensive binary format reference with
  three worked hex-to-CSV decodes.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (v2.0) — dual-implementation architecture
  with Rust↔Python module correspondence.
- `docs/CONFIG-REFERENCE.md` — normative TOML key reference.
- `docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md` — operator-facing error and exit-code
  reference.
- `docs/MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md` — repo layout, daily commands,
  workflows, CI architecture, release process.
- `docs/VENDOR-CSV-DIFFS.md` — alignment statement vs DDC vendor CSV.
- `docs/diagrams/{class,component,dataflow}.{puml,svg}` —
  dual-implementation PlantUML diagrams with committed rendered SVGs.

### Notes

- The Python package previously shipped at `1.1.0` from a pre-Rust-port
  lineage. As of this joint cut, the version aligns at `1.0.0`. This is
  a one-time downward alignment; future Python releases will increment
  forward from `1.0.0` per the impl-prefixed tagging scheme.
- The CHANGELOG starts here. Earlier history exists in `git log` but is
  not retroactively documented as separate entries.
