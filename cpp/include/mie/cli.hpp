// The command-line interface: argument parsing, the subcommand runners, and
// the exit-code contract.
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/cli.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/cli.py`.
// `docs/CLI-REFERENCE.md` is the normative per-flag reference and
// `docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md` the normative exit-code table.
//
// THIS IS WHERE THE PIPELINE IS ASSEMBLED. Every other module is a stage that
// knows only its own job; this one knows the order they go in:
//
//     config -> overrides -> MieFileReader -> FilteredSource -> OrderedSource
//                                                                    |
//                                                               write_csv
//
// PRECEDENCE IS CLI > CONFIG FILE > DEFAULT, and the mechanism matters. A
// presence-only flag (`--strict`, `--no-clobber`, `--allow-partial`,
// `--no-mux`, `--separate-errors`) contributes an override only when it is
// GIVEN. Contributing `false` when absent would silently clobber a `true` the
// operator had set in their config file -- the flag would act as though it
// meant "off" rather than "not specified".
//
// SCOPE. This build implements `decode` and `count`. `dump`, `--manifest`,
// `--glob` and the multi-file merge arrive with the merge module; a flag
// belonging to those is refused with a message that says so, rather than
// reported as unknown, so an operator copying a working Rust invocation learns
// which part is missing rather than doubting the flag name.
