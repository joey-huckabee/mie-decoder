// Group 4 is where the two severity classes live, and the distinction matters

// AnomalyWarn means the record decodes fine but something on the bus looked
// odd. Treating the second as the first produces false negatives on real
// recordings (L2-SYN-024 fires on ordinary bus interference), which is why the
// severity travels with the violation rather than being decided by the caller.
