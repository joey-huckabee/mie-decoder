// Per-RT/MSG DELTA tracking -- the one definition of "the same message", and
// the one place the inter-arrival arithmetic lives.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE
//
// In the Rust and Python implementations DELTA was tracked twice, keyed two
// different ways: a packed integer inside the reader and the
// `"<rt>:<sa><T|R>"` display string inside the merge. Python was worse again --
// the reader spelled the key a third way, hand-building the string on the
// errored-record path because the message does not exist yet there. Nothing
// anywhere asserted that the spellings agreed on what "the same RT/MSG" means.
// They did agree, by care rather than by construction.
//
// C++ reaches this point with `merge` still unwritten, which is the whole
// reason to land the shared type now: the second caller can be built on it
// instead of reproducing the split and then having it extracted back out.
//
// THIS MODULE DOES NOT LOG
//
// `observe()` returns a DeltaOutcome describing what happened, and the caller
// decides whether to say anything. Same rule as `sync`, same reason: a tracker
// cannot know whether a backward step deserves a WARN (single-file decode: yes,
// once per key) or is already reported at file granularity (a merge naming its
// unsorted inputs, L2-MRG-006).
//
// The "have I already mentioned this key" bookkeeping IS kept here, so the
// once-per-key promise has one owner rather than a set in each caller.
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/delta.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/delta.py`.
