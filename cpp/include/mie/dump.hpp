// Hex dump: the diagnostic view of a recording (L2-CLI-009, L2-CLI-013).
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/dump.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/dump.py`, closely
// enough that the three outputs diff cleanly.
//
// Two modes:
//
//   * RAW -- the classic hex+ASCII view of any byte range. It parses nothing,
//     which is the point: it is what an operator reaches for when the decoder
//     has already refused the file and the question is "what is actually in
//     there?"
//
//   * RECORD-AWARE -- walks records, printing a decoded header (Type Word,
//     timestamp, Command Word, and for an errored record the Error Word and its
//     DDC description) above each record's bytes.
//
// THIS MODULE RUNS ON FILES THE DECODER HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP ON. That shapes
// every decision in it: a record it cannot classify degrades to a label rather
// than raising, a scan that hits something impossible prints why and stops
// rather than propagating, and no anomaly here is ever an error the caller has
// to handle. A diagnostic tool that refuses to run on a broken file is no use
// at precisely the moment it is needed.
//
// The three scan-stop anomalies -- an invalid `word_count`, a record whose
// declared extent runs past EOF, and an offset overflow -- are each written
// INLINE into the report and ALSO logged (L2-CLI-013). Both, because the report
// may be piped somewhere the log is not, and the log may be watched by someone
// who never sees the report.
//
// Reading, not mapping. The dump loads the whole file, because it must be able
// to show a file the reader would reject outright, and because the ranges an
// operator asks for are small and arbitrary rather than a streaming walk.
