// EXCLUDE AND INCLUDE ARE NOT OPPOSITES, and the asymmetry is the whole of the
// semantics. An empty include set means "no include constraint", never "include
// nothing" -- otherwise a config that set only `exclude_rts` would drop every
// record in the file. Exclusion is checked first and still applies afterwards,
// so the narrower rule always wins.
//
// A record with NO Command Word (SPURIOUS_DATA) has no RT and no subaddress. It
// therefore cannot satisfy an RT or subaddress INCLUDE filter, and is dropped
// when one is active -- an operator narrowing to RT 5 is not asking to keep
// records that have no RT at all. It is unaffected by RT or subaddress
// EXCLUDE filters, which can only match a value it does not have.
