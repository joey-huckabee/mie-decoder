// The decoder's logger: one global level, four macros, stderr.
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/log.rs`. There is no facade, no handler hierarchy and no
// dependency, for the same reason the CSV writer and the TOML parser are
// hand-rolled: the whole requirement is "put a severity-filtered line on
// stderr", and every logging library available on a SLES 12 build host would be
// a new thing to qualify in exchange for that.
//
// LINE FORMAT is `LEVEL [module] message`, matching the Rust implementation
// word for word. The Python implementation prefixes an ISO timestamp instead
// (`logger.py`), so the three have never been byte-identical here and the
// conformance cases assert stderr by SUBSTRING rather than by equality --
// which is why aligning with Rust costs nothing and reads better side by side.
//
// WHY MACROS AND NOT FUNCTIONS. The message argument is a std::string built by
// concatenation at the call site, so calling a function would build it whether
// or not the level passes. The macros test the level first and never evaluate
// the argument when it fails, which is what keeps a DEBUG line inside the
// per-record loop free at the default WARN level. This is the same reason
// `log_debug!` in Rust is a macro over `format_args!`.
//
// LOCALE. Messages are assembled from `mie::text`'s formatters, never from an
// ostringstream: a stream formats through its imbued locale, and the whole
// point of `scripts/assert-locale-free.sh` is that no number this program
// prints may depend on the host's locale. `text::decimal` and
// `text::hex_upper` are the locale-free spellings, and they return std::string
// so `+` composes them.
