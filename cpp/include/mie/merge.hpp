// Multi-file, time-sorted streaming k-way merge (L1-MRG-*, L2-MRG-*).
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/merge.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/merge.py`.
//
// Takes several decoded recordings and yields one stream of records in global
// time order, holding at most ONE record per open file in a min-heap. Resident
// memory is O(number of files) and independent of the record count
// (L2-MRG-002), which is the same constant-memory property the single-file path
// has and the reason this is a merge rather than a concatenate-then-sort.
//
// The merged stream is a `MessageSource`, so it drops into the same pipeline
// the single-file path uses -- filter, order, writer, all unchanged. That is
// the whole payoff of the Decorator arrangement in `source.hpp`.
//
// EVERY INPUT MUST BE CALENDAR-LOCKED IRIG. A Standard-format input, one that
// leads with a freerun IRIG record, or a set that mixes the two is rejected up
// front (`incompatible_merge_inputs`, exit 6 -- L2-MRG-003). None of those can
// be placed on a common absolute timeline, and merging them would silently
// interleave records by a number that means something different in each file.
//
// DELTA IS PER-FILE BY DEFAULT (L2-MRG-005). Each reader already computed it
// while walking its own file, so the default scope leaves it alone -- which is
// what makes a merged record's DELTA identical to the value the same record
// gets from a single-file decode, by construction rather than by agreement.
// `--delta-scope global` recomputes across the merged timeline instead, using
// the SAME `DeltaTracker` the reader uses. Rust and Python each reached this
// second caller with a second tracker keyed differently from the reader's, and
// nothing asserted the two agreed on what "the same RT/MSG" meant; C++ has one
// definition because `delta.hpp` landed before this module did.
//
// NO NEW DEPENDENCY: the heap is `std::priority_queue` and the `--glob` matcher
// is hand-rolled, preserving the no-runtime-dependency rule (L3-CPP-002).
