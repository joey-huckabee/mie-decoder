// Canonical row order for equal-timestamp ties (L1-OUT-003, L2-WRT-021).
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/order.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/order.py`.
//
// THE STAGE IS RUN-SCOPED, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN POINT. It permutes only a run
// of *consecutive* records that share a `TIME_STAMP`, never the file. A
// whole-file sort would break the constant-memory guarantee every other stage
// upholds, and would violate L2-MRG-006's "never re-sort" rule for a merged
// stream. In practice a run is one or two records: a 1553 bus carries one
// transaction at a time, so real ties come from the two concurrent buses or
// from overlapping recorders in a merge.
//
// THE RUN IS CAPPED (L2-WRT-022). The pathological case is real -- a corrupt
// recording whose timestamps all decode to the same value would otherwise
// buffer the whole file -- so `max_sort_group` turns the one data-dependent
// buffer in the pipeline back into a constant. At the cap the run is emitted in
// arrival order with one WARN. Removing the cap silently reintroduces an
// unbounded allocation.
//
// PINNING IS THE SUBTLE PART. A record with no Command Word (SPURIOUS_DATA) has
// no sort key, and its position is defined RELATIVE TO ITS PREDECESSOR: the
// card writes the leftover words of an errored transaction as a SPURIOUS record
// immediately after it, and the `0x2000` continuation code means "continues the
// record before me". So a pin must travel WITH the record it followed, not sit
// at a preserved index. Sorting by index and holding pins in place looks
// equivalent and is not -- it leaves the pin trailing whichever record the sort
// happened to move into that slot, which breaks exactly the adjacency the
// `0x2000` code depends on.
