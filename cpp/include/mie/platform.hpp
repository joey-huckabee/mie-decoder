// The ONLY module in this tree permitted to touch operating-system APIs.
//
// The MIE decoder proper -- decode, sync, models, filter, order, merge and the
// CSV row formatter -- operates on a `const uint8_t*` plus a length and emits
// bytes. It has no operating-system surface at all and compiles identically on
// SLES 12 SP5 and Windows. Five concerns do touch the OS, and all five live
// here so the rest of the tree stays free of conditional compilation:
//
//   1. mapping the input file read-only
//   2. the atomic temp-file + rename output strategy (L2-WRT-015, L3-WRT-001)
//   3. directory enumeration behind `--glob`
//   4. byte-exact output (no CRLF translation, L2-WRT-012)
//   5. path identity and encoding (L2-WRT-014's InputOutputCollision check)
//
// `scripts/assert-platform-confined.sh` fails the build if any other
// translation unit includes <windows.h>, <sys/mman.h> or their neighbours.
//
// This header names no OS type. Handles are carried as `void*` rather than
// through a pimpl so that including it costs no allocation and drags in no
// platform header -- which is what lets `reader.hpp` hold a MappedFile by
// value without <windows.h> leaking into every consumer.
//
// PATH ENCODING. Paths cross this boundary as UTF-8 std::string, always. The
// Win32 backend widens to UTF-16 and calls the W entry points, so a non-ASCII
// path behaves the way it does under the Rust implementation instead of being
// mangled by whatever the active ANSI codepage happens to be. The POSIX backend
// passes the bytes through untouched.
//
// ERROR STYLE. Nothing here throws. Every fallible call returns bool and fills
// an OsError out-parameter; mapping those to MieError happens in one place in
// the layers above. That keeps the platform layer directly testable and keeps
// OS error text out of the decoder's error type.

/// written with plain rename() would diverge from the Rust behaviour on Windows
/// only -- green on Linux, broken on the shipped Windows binary. The Win32
