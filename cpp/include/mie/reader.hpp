// Memory-mapped sequential reader: the module that turns a file into records.
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/reader.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/reader.py`. It maps
// the input, finds the first record (skipping any leading bytes), resolves the
// timestamp format once, and then walks the record chain yielding decoded
// MieMessages in file order.
//
// THIS IS THE MODULE THAT TALKS. `sync` and `decode` are pure by rule; every
// user-facing WARN, INFO and DEBUG line about the record stream is emitted from
// here, because only here is the caller's context available. `find_first_record`
// returning nothing is the EXPECTED outcome for a valid empty recording and a
// rejection for a wrong file, and the same call cannot know which -- so it says
// nothing and the reader decides.
//
// SYNC RECOVERY IS INTERNAL. A validation failure mid-file is handled here:
// lenient mode scans forward and resumes, and the caller never sees it except
// as a WARN and a bump in `sync_losses()`. Only a strict-mode rejection or an
// exhausted recovery reaches the caller.
//
// ERRORS ARE THROWN, AND THEY ARE TERMINAL. Rust yields `Some(Err(_))` and then
// latches `done`; Python raises out of a generator, which ends it. Throwing
// MieError from `next()` gives C++ the same shape as Python, and the iterator
// latches its done flag BEFORE throwing so that a caller which catches and
// resumes gets a clean end of stream rather than a second attempt at the record
// that just failed.
