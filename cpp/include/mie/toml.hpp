// A parser for a deliberately small subset of TOML: flat `[section]` headers
// and `key = value` lines, where a value is a string, integer, float, boolean,
// or a single-line array of those.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THIS COMPONENT IS MEANT TO BE LIFTABLE
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// It knows nothing about MIE. No decoder type appears in this header, no
// decoder header is included, and nothing here can fail in a way that mentions
// a recording, a record, or a CSV column. What it produces is a document; what
// that document MEANS is `mie/config.hpp`'s business.
//
// That separation is the point. In Fowler's terms this is the mapper's data
// source, not the mapper: the schema — which keys exist, what ranges they take,
// which enum spellings are legal, what the defaults are — lives one layer up.
// Mixing the two is what makes a config loader impossible to reuse, because
// every question you ask it comes back in the vocabulary of one application.
//
// TO LIFT THIS INTO ANOTHER PROJECT you need exactly:
//
//     include/mie/toml.hpp   include/mie/text.hpp
//     src/toml.cpp           src/text.cpp
//     tests/test_toml.cpp
//
// and a namespace rename. `text` is the ASCII-classification and number
// formatting helper; it is depended on rather than duplicated because it is
// itself domain-free, and because this parser MUST NOT use `<cctype>` — those
// functions read the locale table, and under `tr_TR` the lowercase of 'I' is a
// dotless i, which silently breaks case-insensitive key matching. There are no
// other dependencies: no exceptions are thrown, no logging happens, and the
// only standard headers used are <string>, <vector> and <cstdint>.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY A SUBSET, AND WHY REJECTIONS ARE A FEATURE
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The Python implementation parses config with the standard library's full
// `tomllib`. Rust and C++ hand-roll this subset. Where full TOML accepts a form
// the flat schema cannot MODEL — a dotted key, an inline table, a nested table
// header, an array of tables — the hand-rolled parsers must REJECT it rather
// than silently store it somewhere the schema will never look. A silently
// dropped `output.no_clobber = true` is a safety option that appears to be set
// and is not.
//
// Every rejection below therefore has a twin: a form `tomllib` accepts and this
// refuses, on purpose, so all three implementations land in the same class.
// `tests/conformance/config_parity.py` and `config_fuzz.py` hold that line.
