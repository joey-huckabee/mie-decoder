// Streaming CSV output.
//
// Mirrors `rust/src/writer.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/writer.py`.
//
// TWO PROPERTIES DEFINE THIS MODULE, and both are easy to break by accident.
//
// 1. THE COLUMN LAYOUT IS THE VENDOR'S, FOR THE FIRST 44. Column N of a decoded
//    CSV is column N of a DDC-generated CSV, which is what makes a diff against
//    vendor output a validation rather than an exercise in re-mapping. `ERROR`
//    and `ERROR_CODE` are decoder additions with no vendor counterpart, so they
//    go at the TAIL (L1-OUT-001, L2-WRT-001). Through v2.9.0 they sat between
//    `DELTA` and `IM_GAP`, which shifted the three gap columns two positions off
//    their vendor indices -- every positional comparison past `DELTA` was wrong
//    while every column NAME still matched. If you add a column, append it.
//
// 2. ROWS STREAM. A row is formatted and handed to the sink as it arrives;
//    nothing accumulates a container of rows or of messages. That is what makes
//    the O(1)-in-record-count claim true for a multi-gigabyte recording
//    (L3-CPP-011), and it is a design point rather than an optimisation --
//    `AtomicFile` holds one fixed-capacity buffer that is flushed rather than
//    grown.
//
// OUTPUT IS BYTE-EXACT. The sink is opened in binary mode and every line ends
// `\n` on every host (L2-WRT-012); `DELTA` is formatted through
// `mie::text::fixed6`, never `snprintf` directly, so the decimal separator
// cannot follow the host's locale (L3-CPP-007).
