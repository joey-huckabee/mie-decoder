// L1-ROB-001: arbitrary bytes must not crash the decoder.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE, AND NOT libFUZZER. The delivery plan called for libFuzzer
// targets. It is the wrong tool for THIS tree, for three reasons:
//
//   1. libFuzzer needs clang. The defining constraint here is GCC 4.8.5, the
//      SLES 12 system compiler (ADR-0001). A libFuzzer target would run on one
//      of the four C++ tiers and NOT on the one this implementation exists for.
//      A Catch2 test case runs on all of them -- modern g++, GCC 4.8.5, MSVC --
//      and again under ASan/UBSan and valgrind, which is where a genuine memory
//      fault on random input actually surfaces.
//
//   2. The generator below is byte-for-byte the one in
//      `rust/tests/integration.rs` and `python/tests/fuzz_support.py`: same
//      xorshift64, same seed, same size range, same little-endian fill, same
//      draw order. All three implementations therefore see THE SAME INPUTS.
//      L1-ROB-001 is a shared requirement, and testing it three different ways
//      would produce three incomparable results; this way a divergence on
//      identical bytes is detectable.
//
//   3. It is deterministic. Coverage-guided exploration means a required job
//      can fail on an input nobody's change produced, which is the concern
//      was raised against a blocking timed fuzz run when this was scoped.
//
// No committed corpus, for the same reason: the generator reproduces its inputs
// exactly, so a corpus would be storage for something already derivable.
//
// THREE KNOBS, SHARED WITH THE RUST AND PYTHON HARNESSES. All three read the
// same environment variables and mean the same thing by them, because a burn-in
// scoped differently per language cannot be compared across languages -- which
// is the subject of `docs/FUZZING.md` section 1.
//
//   MIE_FUZZ_ITERATIONS   inputs to generate (256 reader/dump, 512 merge)
//   MIE_FUZZ_STREAM_LOGS  `1` / `true` -> leave the decoder's logger at WARN so
//                         its diagnostics stream; anything else -> LEVEL_OFF
//   MIE_FUZZ_SUMMARY      file to append this run's FUZZ-SUMMARY line to
//
// WHY THE LOG KNOB IS THE HARNESS'S JOB AND NOT THE RUNNER'S. The logger writes
// to the stderr file descriptor, which Catch2 does not redirect -- so no runner
// flag controls it in either direction. Before this knob existed a scheduled
// burn-in wrote roughly forty megabytes of WARN lines into every CI run whether
// or not anyone had asked for them.
//
// This file holds THREE cases -- reader, dump and merge input resolution.
// The defaults run in seconds and ride along with every `make
// check`. `make check-fuzz` runs ONLY this file's cases, which is what the
// nightly burn-in uses so its wall time measures fuzzing rather than the whole
// suite; `make check` is deliberately left as the single unparameterised
// command a developer runs. Since the PRNG is deterministic, a burn-in is a
// strict SUPERSET of the default run -- the first 256 inputs are identical.
