# MIE-Decoder — Maintainer Guide

Operational reference for anyone modifying the MIE-Decoder codebase. Covers the workflows you'll repeat: adding requirements, tests, conformance fixtures, error variants, and CLI flags; running the trace matrix; bumping coverage; releasing.

This guide is for **maintainers**. End-user CLI usage belongs in [`docs/USER-GUIDE.md`](USER-GUIDE.md); error/exit-code reference for operators lives in [`docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md`](ERROR-CATALOG.md); LLM-session project conventions live in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## 2. Local development setup

### Rust

```bash
rustup update stable
rustup default stable
rustup component add clippy rustfmt llvm-tools-preview
cd rust
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Python

```bash
pipx install poetry==2.3.4   # or via your usual install
poetry -C python sync         # creates the venv, installs locked deps + mie_decoder
poetry -C python run pytest
```

The Python package is installed in editable mode via `poetry sync`'s root-package step. If `python -m mie_decoder` ever fails to import in your local Poetry env, re-run sync.

### Cross-impl conformance (needs both)

```bash
# Build the Rust binary first so the runner doesn't have to:
(cd rust && cargo build)
# Then run the suite (uses Poetry's interpreter for the Python side):
poetry -C python run python ../tests/conformance/run.py
```

The runner reads `tests/conformance/manifest.json`, materializes each `.hex` fixture into a temp `.mie` file, invokes both CLIs against it, and diffs the produced CSVs against the checked-in oracle (or asserts the exit code for negative cases).

When both CLIs are present, the runner additionally cross-checks the two **config parsers** (`tomllib` vs the hand-rolled Rust parser accept different TOML subsets): a curated corpus (`config_parity.py`) plus a differential **fuzzer** (`config_fuzz.py`) that generates config documents and asserts both implementations agree on accept/reject. Both run inside `run.py` — there is no separate command. The fuzzer is deterministic (fixed seed + `MIE_CONFIG_FUZZ_ITERS` iterations, default 100); for a deeper local sweep run `MIE_CONFIG_FUZZ_ITERS=5000 poetry -C python run python ../tests/conformance/run.py` (a *distinct* knob from the reader/dump `MIE_FUZZ_ITERATIONS` in §11's fuzz workflow). A divergence prints the exact config to pin in `config_parity.py`. See `tests/conformance/README.md`.

A third guard, `config_path_parity.py`, covers the layer above the parsers: the `--config` **path** rather than its contents. The other two never vary the path, so what counts as a usable config file — and which exit code and message a bad one produces — was pinned only by per-implementation unit tests that could drift apart unnoticed. It compares the **exact exit code** (not just accept/reject) and requires the promised message text from both CLIs, over the surface documented in `CONFIG-REFERENCE.md` §"Trust boundary": regular files only, missing/unusable is exit `5`, and any readable location is accepted (spaces, non-ASCII names, `..` segments). Platform-dependent cases (character devices, symlinks) skip themselves and report the skip, so a corpus that quietly shrinks on one OS is visible.

## 3. Daily-command cheat sheet

```bash
# Rust (from rust/)
cargo test --all-targets                         # all unit + integration
cargo test --lib reader::tests::skips_proprietary_header   # single test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
cargo cov-ci                                     # coverage gate (alias in rust/.cargo/config.toml)
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps   # rustdoc link check (CI-gated)
cargo +1.88 check --all-targets                  # MSRV 1.88 floor (CI-gated)
cargo deny check                                 # supply-chain audit (CI-gated; config rust/deny.toml)
cargo semver-checks check-release --baseline-rev "$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)" --release-type minor  # public-API break check (CI-gated)

# Python (from repo root)
poetry -C python run pytest                      # all tests
poetry -C python run pytest tests/test_e2e.py -k delta -v
poetry -C python run mypy src                    # strict type check (CI-gated)

poetry -C python run ruff check                  # ruff lint (CI-gated)
poetry -C python run ruff format                 # auto-format (CI runs `ruff format --check`)
poetry -C python run vulture                     # dead-code scan (CI-gated)
poetry -C python run bandit -r src/mie_decoder   # security scan / SAST (CI-gated)
poetry -C python run pytest --cov               # coverage gate (fail_under=92 in pyproject.toml)
poetry -C python run python ../tests/conformance/run.py

# Filter pytest by requirement marker
python scripts/pytest-by-requirement.py L2-WRT-015
python scripts/pytest-by-requirement.py L3-PY-          # whole L3-PY-* family

# Trace matrix

python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py --check     # what CI does — exits 1 on drift

# Diagnose a vendor CSV whose DELTA column disagrees with ours
# (reads the vendor CSV only — no MIE file, no decoder run)
python scripts/diagnose-vendor-delta.py vendor.csv

# PlantUML diagrams

# CLI dry-runs against a real file
(cd rust && cargo run --release -- decode path/to/recording.mie -o decoded.csv)
poetry -C python run mie-decoder decode path/to/recording.mie -o decoded.csv
```

Commit each `docs/diagrams/*.puml` source with its matching rendered
`docs/diagrams/*.svg`. Regenerate the SVG whenever the PlantUML source changes —
**nothing in CI will catch you if you don't** (the `diagrams` job is a known
no-op; see §9 and `ROADMAP.md`).

Two traps when regenerating:

- **The output file is named after `@startuml <name>`, not the source.**
  `plantuml -tsvg docs/diagrams/class.puml` writes
  `MIE-Decoder Class Diagram.svg`. Rename it onto `class.svg` yourself.
- **PlantUML exits 0 on a crashed render**, leaving a truncated SVG. Grep the
  render output for `Exception`, and sanity-check the result (`class.svg`
  should contain every type declared in `class.puml`; a whole
  `component.svg` is ~60 KB, a crashed one ~14 KB).

The committed SVGs are rendered with PlantUML **1.2026.7beta11**, from the
project's rolling `snapshot` pre-release — on the stable releases tested,
`component.puml` crashes in the smetana layout engine. Read the
`<?plantuml VERSION?>` processing instruction inside any committed `*.svg` to
confirm what produced it. Note also that PlantUML lays out using the JVM's font
metrics, so re-rendering an *unchanged* source on a different machine will
still shift the canvas; expect byte differences that are not content changes.

---

## 4. Adding a requirement

The three-tier system: **L1** = system SHALL statement; **L2** = architectural derivation with one L1 parent; **L3** = implementation obligation with one L2 parent.

### Choose the tier

- **L1** — a new product-level capability or constraint. Rare. The 12 categories in `docs/L1-REQ.md` (`DEC`, `OUT`, `DLT`, `CLI`, `LOG`, `MODE`, `SYN`, `ERR`, `CFG`, `CONF`, `EXIT`, `ROB`) are stable; pick the closest fit.
- **L2** — a behavior derived from an existing L1. Most new requirements land here. Pick the L2 category that names the behavior (`L2-DEC-*`, `L2-WRT-*`, `L2-SYN-*`, etc.).
- **L3** — an implementation detail. Use `L3-PY-*` for Python-only constraints, `L3-RS-*` for Rust-only, or the L2's category code for cross-impl detail (e.g., `L3-WRT-001` pins the temp-file naming pattern derived from `L2-WRT-015`).

### Add the ID

Pick the next integer in the category — retired IDs are never reused. The current max per category is visible in `docs/L1-REQ.md` / `L2-REQ.md` / `L3-REQ.md` category tables.

**L1 format** (in `L1-REQ.md`):

```markdown
### L1-XXX-NNN

**Statement**: [SHALL obligation]

**Rationale**: [why this requirement exists]

**Verification Method**: Test (T)
```

**L2 format** (in `L2-REQ.md`):

```markdown
#### L2-XXX-NNN

**Parent**: L1-XXX-NNN
**Statement**: ...
**Rationale**: ...
**Verification Method**: Test (T)
```

**L3 format** (in `L3-REQ.md`, compact two-line):

```markdown
**L3-XXX-NNN** · Parent: L2-XXX-NNN · Verification: T
Statement text on the next line.
```

### Choose the verification method

Single letters from DO-178: **T** = Test, **I** = Inspection, **A** = Analysis, **D** = Demonstration. Multiple methods comma-separated.

- **Test (T)** — there's an automated test asserting the behavior. The trace matrix expects a `@pytest.mark.requirement` marker or a `/// Requirements:` doc-comment.
- **Inspection (I)** — verified by reading the source. Use for structural properties (a single function called from three places, an enum being exhaustively matched, build config declarations).
- **Analysis (A)** — verified by logical/mathematical argument. Use for bounded-loop proofs, memory complexity claims.
- **Demonstration (D)** — verified by operator running the system. Use for things like "release binary runs on the target deployment host".

Don't mark `Test (T)` if no test exists or will exist. The matrix will surface it as **Draft** and the gap will be obvious.

**An I / A / D requirement needs an `**Evidence**` line too.** Add it under `**Verification Method**`, naming in backticks what carries the check — the script, CI job, or source symbol a reader can go look at:

```markdown
**Verification Method**: Inspection (I)
**Evidence**: `scripts/repo-hygiene.sh` — its no-MIE-recordings-tracked check
scans the whole tracked tree and fails the repo-hygiene CI job.
```

Those backticked names become the row's artifact column. Without an `**Evidence**` line the requirement stays **Draft**, exactly like a `Test (T)` requirement with no marker — before v2.12.0 a bare method letter was enough to report `Implemented (I)`, which is how three requirements came to claim they were met beside a literal `_(TBD)_` in their own artifact column. A declared method is a plan; evidence is a result. L3 statements are one-liners, so theirs rides on the same line: `· Evidence: \`path/to/thing\``.

### Tag the test

Once an L1/L2/L3 ID exists, tag whichever tests verify it:

**Python** (in `python/tests/`):

```python
@pytest.mark.requirement("L2-WRT-015")
def test_temp_file_rename_is_atomic(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    ...
```

Multiple markers stack:

```python
@pytest.mark.requirement("L2-CLI-011")
@pytest.mark.requirement("L1-EXIT-002")
def test_cli_no_valid_records_returns_exit_2(...):
    ...
```

**Rust** (`rust/src/**/*.rs` and `rust/tests/*.rs`):

```rust
/// Requirements: L2-WRT-015
#[test]
fn temp_file_rename_is_atomic() { ... }
```

Multiple IDs comma-separated on one line:

```rust
/// Requirements: L2-WRT-015, L2-WRT-016, L3-WRT-001
#[test]
fn atomic_commit_renames_temp_over_destination() { ... }
```

### Regenerate the trace matrix

After adding the spec / tags:

```bash
python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py
git add docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md
```

If you forget, CI's `trace-matrix` job (`python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py --check`) will fail with a clear message.

---

## 5. Adding a test

### Test pyramid

The project uses four test tiers, narrowest scope at the bottom:

| Tier                  | Subject                                  | Location                            | Run with                                         | Cross-platform |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Unit**              | one function / one module, in-process    | `rust/src/<module>.rs` `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` (Rust); `python/tests/test_*.py` (Python) | `cargo test --lib` / `pytest`                    | Linux + Windows |
| **Integration**       | multiple modules via the library API, in-process | `rust/tests/integration.rs` (Rust); `python/tests/test_integration_*.py` (Python) | `cargo test --test integration` / `pytest`       | Linux + Windows |
| **CLI acceptance**    | the **built binary** as a subprocess — exit codes, stdout, stderr, filesystem effects | `rust/tests/cli.rs` (Rust)               | `cargo test --test cli`                          | Linux + Windows |
| **Conformance**       | byte-exact cross-impl equivalence (Rust ↔ Python CLI) | `tests/conformance/`                | `poetry -C python run python ../tests/conformance/run.py` | Linux + Windows |

The two upper tiers both spawn the actual binary, but they serve different purposes:

- **CLI acceptance** (`rust/tests/cli.rs`) is Rust-only. It covers behaviors that conformance can't or doesn't: `--no-clobber`, input/output collision rejection, `--include-*` filter syntax (L3-RS-010; Python provides the same filters per L3-PY-013 and covers them in its own test suite), `--help` / `--version`, exit-class taxonomy, and other CLI surfaces where stdout/stderr/exit-code semantics matter more than CSV byte-equality.
- **Conformance** (`tests/conformance/`) holds Rust and Python to byte-identical CSV output (or matching exit code for negative cases). Anything that affects the CSV contract should land here so both implementations stay aligned.

When you add a behavior, ask: **does this need to behave the same in Python?** If yes, add it to conformance. If no (Rust-only feature, atomic-write artifact, exit-class taxonomy detail), add it to `rust/tests/cli.rs`. Both tiers run on Linux and Windows automatically via `cargo test --all-targets`.

### Python

Tests live in `python/tests/test_*.py`. Use the synthetic-record builders in `python/tests/conftest.py` if you need varied IRIG timestamps or errored / SPURIOUS records:

- `normal_record_rt15_sa11_us(microseconds)` — varies only the timestamp on the canonical receive record.
- `errored_record_rt15_sa11_us(microseconds)` — Type Word bit 14 set, 0x011E error code.
- `spurious_record_us(microseconds, data_word)` — SPURIOUS_DATA shape.

For end-to-end CLI tests, use `pytest.LogCaptureFixture` to assert on log messages, e.g. the `decode exit class:` summary line.

### Rust unit and integration

Unit tests live next to the code they test in `rust/src/<module>.rs` under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }`. Library-level integration tests live in `rust/tests/integration.rs`.

Use the existing `TempFile` helper at the bottom of `rust/src/reader.rs` (private) or `rust/tests/integration.rs` (also private but copy-paste-friendly). For new variants, construct minimal byte sequences from the canonical `RECORD_RT15_SA11_RCV` shape.

Always tag new tests with `/// Requirements:` so the trace matrix credits them.

### Rust CLI acceptance

CLI acceptance tests in `rust/tests/cli.rs` spawn the actual built binary located via `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_mie-decoder")` (Cargo populates this per test target and appends `.exe` on Windows automatically — no per-OS code paths needed) and use `std::process::Command::output()` to invoke it. Style conventions:

- Use the `TempDir` helper in the same file: per-test scratch directories under `std::env::temp_dir()`, keyed by pid + atomic counter, removed on drop. Tests can then use plain `dir/input.mie`, `dir/output.csv` paths.
- Use the `run([...])` helper rather than `Command::new` directly. It echoes any captured stderr into test output so a Windows CI failure can be triaged from the runner log without re-running locally.
- Assert on exit code via the `exit_code(&out)` helper, on stdout/stderr via `String::from_utf8_lossy` + `.contains(...)`, and on filesystem effects with `std::fs::read[_to_string]`.
- Don't byte-compare CSV output — that's conformance's job. Acceptance tests should assert on coarser invariants (header row exists, row count >= 2, sentinel preserved when `--no-clobber` refused).
- Cross-platform considerations: never hard-code `/` or `\\` in paths (use `PathBuf::join` and pass paths as `OsStr`); never assert on `\n` vs `\r\n` (use substring `.contains()` on stdout/stderr).

Always tag new tests with `/// Requirements:` so the trace matrix credits them.

Run locally with:

```bash
cd rust
cargo test --test cli                  # CLI suite only
cargo test --test cli -- --nocapture   # also show stdout / stderr from the spawned binary
cargo test --all-targets               # unit + integration + cli together (what CI runs)
```

---

## 6. Adding a conformance fixture

Cross-implementation conformance fixtures verify byte-identical CSV output (or matching exit code) between Rust and Python. Add a case only for behavior that's specified at L2 as shared.

### Steps

1. Build the hex fixture under `tests/conformance/inputs/`. Include a header comment naming the requirement(s) it exercises. Example: `tests/conformance/inputs/homogeneous-payload.hex`.

2. If the case expects a successful decode (default), generate the CSV oracle. Run both implementations against your fixture and compare manually until they agree, then commit the agreed output to `tests/conformance/expected/<name>.csv`.

3. For negative cases (no oracle, just exit-code check), set `expected_exit` in the manifest and skip the oracle file.

   **Multi-file merge cases** use `"inputs": ["inputs/a.hex", "inputs/b.hex", …]` (a list) instead of the single `"input"` — the runner materializes each hex to its own temp `.mie` and passes them all as positionals to both CLIs (L2-MRG-001). See the `merge-ordered` (oracle) and `merge-incompatible-freerun` (`expected_exit: 6`) cases. Note: the `--allow-partial` merge path needs >64 KB of garbage to force an unrecoverable sync loss, which isn't a small reviewable hex fixture, so it's covered by a library test in each implementation (`merge_allow_partial_*`) rather than a conformance case.

4. Register in `tests/conformance/manifest.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-case",
     "input": "inputs/your-case.hex",
     "expected": "expected/your-case.csv"
   }
   ```

   For negative cases:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-case",
     "input": "inputs/your-case.hex",
     "expected_exit": 2
   }
   ```

   For strict-mode cases:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-case",
     "input": "inputs/your-case.hex",
     "expected_exit": 1,
     "config": "configs/strict.toml"
   }
   ```

5. For cases that need extra CLI flags, add a single `args` array — it is passed verbatim to both CLIs, which share one argument surface. Don't add a fixture for an implementation-specific behavior (those go in each impl's own test suite per L1-CONF-001).

6. Run the suite locally to confirm:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   poetry -C python run python ../tests/conformance/run.py
   ```

7. Update the count in any docs that mention "N conformance cases" (this guide, etc.).

See `tests/conformance/README.md` for the full manifest schema.

---

## 7. Adding an error variant

When a new error class is needed (per `docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md` taxonomy), land it in both crates and document.

### Rust (`rust/src/error.rs`)

1. Add the variant to `enum MieError { ... }` with `offset` and any structured detail fields.
2. Add a matching value to `enum MieErrorKind`.
3. Extend `MieError::kind()` to map the new variant.
4. Add a match arm to the `impl fmt::Display for MieError` block with the user-facing message.
5. Classify it: add it to `is_record_error()` (tied to one record's byte offset), to `is_file_error()` (an I/O failure on the input itself), or to **neither** — whole-file rejections and destination guards deliberately answer `false` to both. Then list it in the matching arm of `every_error_kind_is_deliberately_classified` in `rust/src/error.rs`, which fails if a variant appears in no list, and mirror the decision in the Python test. Carrying an `offset` does not by itself make a variant record-class: `HomogeneousPayload` and `TimestampFormatMismatch` cite an offset but reject the whole file.

### Python (`python/src/mie_decoder/exceptions.py`)

1. Add a new class extending `MieFileError` or `MieRecordError` as appropriate. Follow the existing pattern: `__init__` sets typed attributes and calls `super().__init__(message)`.
2. Add a class-level docstring naming the L1/L2 requirement(s) it satisfies.

### CLI exit-code mapping

`rust/src/cli.rs` and `python/src/mie_decoder/cli.py` both have a try/except (or `match`) chain that maps errors to exit codes. Decide which class the new error belongs to (see `docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md` section 1):

- Wrong-file-type / file-shape errors → exit 2 (alongside `NoValidRecords`)
- Unrecoverable mid-file → exit 3 (alongside `UnrecoverableSyncLoss`)
- Generic record / I/O / writer → exit 1 (the default branch)

Add the explicit handler and update the corresponding `decode exit class:` log line.

### Documentation

1. Update `docs/ERROR-CATALOG.md`:
   - Add a row in section 3 (file-level) or section 4 (record-level).
   - If the error introduces new operator-visible behavior, add to the decision tree in section 9.
2. Tag any new tests with the requirement ID and regenerate the trace matrix.
3. If the variant pins a NEW requirement (rather than implementing an existing one), add the L2 / L3 to the spec docs first.

### Cross-impl alignment

Both crates **must** raise the same variant for the same input. Add a conformance fixture (negative case, `expected_exit`) if the exit-code class is new, so future drift is caught.

---

## 8. Adding a CLI flag

L1-CLI-001 only requires the two CLIs to offer the same capabilities; their syntax MAY differ. In practice they have been kept to an **identical flag surface** across `decode` / `count` / `dump` — add the flag to both implementations with the same name and semantics so that parity holds. Two things enforce this: the conformance suite drives both CLIs from a single shared `args` vector (so a flag missing from one side breaks any case that uses it), and the `check_cli_surface` gate in `tests/conformance/run.py` compares the two CLIs' full long-flag sets (extracted from their `--help` output) and **fails the conformance run if they diverge** — naming the offending flag. So a flag added to only one implementation fails CI even if no case exercises it; add it to both (and keep the help text advertising it, since the gate reads `--help`).

### Rust (`rust/src/cli.rs`)

The CLI argparse is hand-rolled. Add the flag in the relevant subcommand's parser. Wire it into the appropriate path (`run_decode`, `run_count`, `run_dump`). Add `parse_*` unit tests for the new flag (greedy / non-greedy / repeats / `=value`) following the existing `filter_flag_*` pattern.

### Python (`python/src/mie_decoder/cli.py`)

Add an `argparse` argument to the relevant subparser. Wire it the same way.

### Config schema

If the flag has a TOML counterpart (which it usually should for site-wide config), update `config/default.toml` with the new key (commented out, with a description), the L2-CFG-008 schema reference in `docs/L2-REQ.md`, and both `config.rs` / `config.py` to load and validate the key.

### Tests

- Per-impl unit tests that the flag is parsed correctly.
- Per-impl end-to-end test that the flag changes behavior.
- A conformance fixture if the resulting behavior is cross-impl visible (typically yes).

## 9. CI architecture

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines the jobs below. The table is the list —
it is cross-checked against the workflow, so a job added without a row here
shows up as a gap rather than silently drifting:

| Job | What it gates | Platforms | Failure cost |
|-----|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| `rust` | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all-targets` (unit + `rust/tests/integration.rs` + `rust/tests/cli.rs` CLI acceptance suite — see section 5 for the test pyramid); `cargo cov-ci` (87% line / 86% region coverage floors) Linux-only | `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest` | Block merge |
| `rust-doc` | `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps` — fails on broken intra-doc links and other rustdoc lints in the doc-heavy crate | `ubuntu-latest` | Block merge |
| `rust-msrv` | `cargo check --all-targets` on the pinned **1.88** toolchain — enforces the declared `rust-version` (the main `rust` job builds on stable) | `ubuntu-latest` | Block merge |
| `cargo-deny` | `cargo deny check` — RustSec advisories, license allow-list, bans (duplicates/wildcards), and crates.io-only sources (config in `rust/deny.toml`) | `ubuntu-latest` | Block merge |
| `cargo-semver-checks` | `cargo semver-checks check-release` vs the latest release tag (`baseline-rev`, `release-type: minor`) — fails a PR that makes a **breaking** public-API change without a major bump; additive changes pass | `ubuntu-latest` | Block merge |
| `python` | `poetry sync` + `poetry run pytest`; `poetry check --strict --lock` + `poetry build` Linux/3.12-only | 5 versions × Linux (3.10–3.14), 2 versions × Windows (3.12, 3.14) | Block merge |
| `mypy` | `poetry run mypy src` — strict type check, analyzed as Python 3.10 (config in `python/pyproject.toml`) | `ubuntu-latest` (3.12) | Block merge |
| `pylint` | `poetry run pylint src/mie_decoder` — lints the package; curated disables + line length in `python/pyproject.toml` `[tool.pylint.*]` (gate fails below 10/10) | `ubuntu-latest` (3.12) | Block merge |
| `ruff` | `poetry run ruff check` + `poetry run ruff format --check` — fast lint + formatter check over the package **and tests** (config in `python/pyproject.toml` `[tool.ruff]`); run `ruff format` to fix | `ubuntu-latest` (3.12) | Block merge |
| `vulture` | `poetry run vulture` — dead-code scan over the package **and tests**; scan paths + intentional-name ignores (interface args, documented constants) in `python/pyproject.toml` `[tool.vulture]` | `ubuntu-latest` (3.12) | Block merge |
| `bandit` | `poetry run bandit -r src/mie_decoder` — Python security static analysis (SAST) over the package source; fails on any finding at the default severity/confidence | `ubuntu-latest` (3.12) | Block merge |
| `python-coverage` | `poetry run pytest --cov` — 92% combined line+branch floor (`fail_under` in `python/pyproject.toml`) | `ubuntu-latest` (3.12) | Block merge |
| `conformance` | `pip install -e ./python` then `python tests/conformance/run.py --skip cpp` — every fixture, Rust and Python. The opt-out is explicit: the runner defaults to every registered implementation and fails if one is missing, so this job cannot pass by silently testing fewer | `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest` | Block merge |
| `trace-matrix` | `python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py --check` — fails if `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md` is stale relative to the spec docs + test markers | `ubuntu-latest` | Block merge |
| `repo-hygiene` | `bash scripts/repo-hygiene.sh` — re-runs the pre-commit hook's file-level checks (final newline, CRLF, merge markers, 1 MB cap, `*.mie`, `Cargo.lock` parity, `dbg!()`, `unsafe`/`SAFETY:`) over the whole tracked tree, so a `--no-verify` commit is still caught, plus the doc-drift checks that have no hook counterpart (this table lists every `ci.yml` job; the config-key set agrees across its three text sources; no TRACE-MATRIX row claims Implemented with no artifact; the declared Rust MSRV agrees across `Cargo.toml`, CI and the docs; `ROADMAP.md` doesn't restate a `TRACE-MATRIX.md` status; the Python exception hierarchy matches its ASCII-tree and UML drawings) | `ubuntu-latest` | Block merge |
| `diagrams` | Re-renders every `docs/diagrams/*.puml` with the pinned PlantUML version and runs `git diff --exit-code` against the committed `*.svg`. **Currently a no-op** — PlantUML names its output after `@startuml <name>`, so the render lands in untracked files and the tracked `*.svg` are never compared; see the "Diagram rendering" section of `ROADMAP.md` | `ubuntu-latest` | Passes regardless |

The jobs above are `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which gates the Rust and Python
implementations. The C++ implementation gates separately in
`.github/workflows/cpp-ci.yml`, so a Rust change never waits on a Valgrind run
and a C++ change never waits on the Python matrix. Its jobs:

| Job | What it does | Runner | Gate |
|-----|--------------|--------|------|
| `build-test-modern` | `make check` on a pinned modern g++. Fast feedback, and the only Linux tier whose compiler is new enough to host the instrumentation below | `ubuntu-24.04` | Any test failure |
| `build-test-gcc48` | `make check-gcc48` — builds and runs the **full suite** inside the pinned GCC 4.8.5 mirror image. The tier that proves C++11 conformance on the SLES 12 SP5 system compiler (ADR-0001). Do not reduce it to a compile check | `ubuntu-24.04` (container) | Any test failure |
| `build-test-msvc` | CMake + MSVC at `/W4 /WX /permissive-`, then `ctest`, then a smoke check that stdout carries no CR. Windows is a shipping target, not a convenience build (ADR-0003) | `windows-2022` | Any test failure, any warning |
| `sanitizers` | `make check SANITIZE=1` — AddressSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer and LeakSanitizer, all fatal on first finding. Modern toolchain only; GCC 4.8 has partial ASan and no LSan | `ubuntu-24.04` | Any finding |
| `valgrind` | `make check-valgrind` with `--errors-for-leak-kinds=all`. A still-reachable block at exit is a leak for a short-lived CLI, not a tolerable steady state | `ubuntu-24.04` | Any leak or invalid access |
| `coverage` | `make -C cpp coverage` — rebuilds from clean with `--coverage` at `-O0`, runs the **full** Catch2 suite, gates with `gcovr` on 90% lines and 76% branches. Driven through the Makefile target so this job and a developer's `make coverage` are one invocation with one threshold — deliberately one number rather than a tighter CI-only value, because gcov branch counts vary ~5pp with compiler version and a CI-only floor would let local pass while CI failed. Excludes the conformance suite, as the Rust and Python gates do — it drives the CLI out-of-process, and counting it would measure a different thing in each implementation | `ubuntu-24.04` | Below either floor |
| `static-analysis` | `cppcheck` over `cpp/src` and `cpp/tests`. Vendored Catch2 excluded — it is third-party code the project is forbidden to edit | `ubuntu-24.04` | Any finding |
| `clang-tidy` | `bear` generates a compilation database from the real build, then `make tidy` runs clang-tidy with `--warnings-as-errors`. Without that flag clang-tidy exits 0 on warnings and the gate reports success while printing findings | `ubuntu-24.04` | Any finding |
| `format` | `make format-check`. Covers **both** platform backends, not just the one this host compiles — the inactive backend is checked by no other tier | `ubuntu-24.04` | Any diff |
| `cpp-conformance` | The C++ binary against the **same** byte-exact oracles in `tests/conformance/expected/`, via `run.py --only cpp`. Needs no cargo and no installed `mie_decoder`, because it compares against the committed oracles rather than against the other CLIs. The C++ build runs **every** case in the manifest, so nothing is skipped | `ubuntu-24.04`, `windows-2022` | Block merge |
| `invariants` | The three properties that make the portability claim true rather than aspirational: OS headers confined to the platform backends, no locale-sensitive parsing or formatting, and the Makefile and CMake resolving the same source list | `ubuntu-24.04` | Any violation |

Each of the three `invariants` gates has been verified to fail on a planted
violation as well as to pass on clean code. A check that has only ever been
seen passing is not known to work.

Three further workflows cut **across** all three implementations rather than
gating one of them:

| Workflow / job | Covers | Notes |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| `cross-impl-differential` | all three | **The only job that runs all three implementations together**, and therefore the only one that can run the differential config checks (`config_parity`, `config_fuzz`, `config_path_parity`), which compare **all pairs** and skip themselves when fewer than two implementations are selected. Lives alone in `.github/workflows/differential.yml`. It runs `run.py` with no `--only` / `--skip`, so a missing implementation is an error rather than a smaller pass. Deliberately **unfiltered**: it previously lived in `cpp-ci.yml` behind a `cpp/**` filter, which meant the check written to catch a divergence *between* implementations only ran when the C++ tree changed. Its first run found two real divergences. |
| `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | `rust`, `python`, `c-cpp` | Rust and Python use `build-mode: none` and extract from source. C++ **must** be compiled — the extractor observes a real build — so it uses `build-mode: manual` with an explicit `make -C cpp all`. Not `autobuild`: this tree has a specific build driven by `sources.txt`, and letting an extractor guess is how it silently analyses less than you think. `all` compiles every translation unit without running the suite, which is what the extractor needs. |
| `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` | `rust/src`, `python/src`, `cpp/src`, `cpp/include` | The CFamily analyser cannot read C++ from source alone; it needs the compile flags per translation unit. This passes `sonar.cfamily.compile-commands` pointing at the database `bear` writes, rather than using SonarCloud's build-wrapper, so the analyser sees the flags the **real** build uses instead of a second description that could drift from `sources.txt`. Vendored Catch2 and the per-toolchain `build/` trees are excluded. |

One caveat from when C++ analysis was added is still live: **measure before
making C++ blocking.**
The tree joins a job that already waits on the quality gate, so if the first
analysis surfaces a large pile of style findings, the answer is to scope C++ to
the security and taint rules — the ones no other gate here runs — rather than to
unpick the integration. clang-tidy 20, cppcheck, ASan, UBSan, LSan and Valgrind
already cover the rest.

The Rust and Python deployment targets are Linux. Windows cells exist to catch path / encoding / line-ending portability bugs early, not because Windows is a production target. Coverage gates (Rust + Python), lockfile-and-metadata check, and dist build run on Linux only — Windows is functional smoke. Coverage isn't platform- or interpreter-dependent, so neither coverage gate fans out across its respective matrix.

The `diagrams` job pins PlantUML to `1.2026.5`, which is **not** the version that produced the committed SVGs (`1.2026.7beta11`, from the unpinnable rolling `snapshot` pre-release — read the `<?plantuml VERSION?>` processing instruction inside any `docs/diagrams/*.svg`). That mismatch went unnoticed because the job never compares the tracked files at all. Three independent defects and the reproducibility constraint on any replacement are written up under "Diagram rendering" in `ROADMAP.md`.

A separate scheduled workflow, `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`, runs a deeper L1-ROB-001 fuzz burn-in daily (and on manual `workflow_dispatch`), across **all three** implementations. The normal `rust` / `python` / C++ suites run the fixed 256-iteration default; the burn-in sets `MIE_FUZZ_ITERATIONS` (default 25 000) so the deterministic harness sweeps a much larger input space.

All three harnesses use the **same xorshift64 generator with the same seed**, so they see the same inputs — which is what makes a divergence between implementations on identical bytes detectable, rather than three incomparable robustness efforts. C++ deliberately does **not** use libFuzzer: it needs clang, so it would skip the GCC 4.8.5 fidelity tier this implementation exists for, and its non-determinism would make a required gate fail on inputs no change produced. The C++ harness is an ordinary Catch2 case (`cpp/tests/test_fuzz.cpp`), so it rides along on every tier including MSVC, ASan/UBSan and Valgrind, with no separate target and no committed corpus. Because the PRNG seed is fixed, the burn-in is a strict superset of the default run and any failure prints a reproducible seed. To reproduce locally: `MIE_FUZZ_ITERATIONS=25000 cargo test --test integration fuzz_arbitrary_bytes_never_panic` or `MIE_FUZZ_ITERATIONS=25000 poetry -C python run pytest tests/test_e2e.py::TestFuzzHarness`.

Pre-commit hooks (set up locally via `bash scripts/install-hooks.sh`, which points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`) run a subset of the above on staged content: trailing-whitespace / CRLF / merge-marker scans, rust/Cargo.lock parity, `python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py --check` (whenever Rust source, Python tests, the L1/L2/L3 docs, or the matrix itself are staged), `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all-targets`, a `dbg!()` scan in staged Rust, and a `// SAFETY:` comment requirement for new `unsafe` blocks. These mirror what CI checks so push-fails are rare. The pre-commit hooks do **not** regenerate diagrams or rebuild SVGs, and neither does CI in practice — the `diagrams` job is a known no-op (§9), so a stale SVG is currently caught by nobody. Re-render by hand, following §3.

---

## 10. Coverage workflow

All three implementations are gated. Rust uses `cargo-llvm-cov`; Python uses `pytest-cov` (which wraps `coverage.py`); C++ uses `gcov` via `gcovr`. Each gate runs once on Linux only — coverage isn't platform-dependent, so fanning the gate across the full matrix would waste CI minutes.

**None of the three includes the conformance suite.** Rust measures its `cargo test` targets, Python measures `python/tests`, C++ measures the Catch2 suite. The conformance runner drives each CLI out-of-process, so counting it would measure a different thing in each implementation and make the numbers incomparable. Paths reached only through conformance therefore read as uncovered — the conservative direction.

**The second metric is not the same thing in each language, and the floors reflect that.** Rust gates on llvm-cov *regions*, Python and C++ on *branches*. `gcov` counts every conditional the compiler emits, including ones the source never spells out, so it runs systematically lower than LLVM region coverage for equally well-tested code. Forcing the three numbers to match would not make them mean the same thing.

| | lines | regions / branches | floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rust | 90.40% | 89.37% (regions) | 90 / 89 |
| Python | 95.50% | 92.89% (branches) | 92 combined |
| C++ | 90.9% CI / 91.1% local | 81.5% CI / 76.5% local (branches) | 90 / 76 |

The C++ row has two numbers because **gcov branch coverage is not portable across compiler versions**: the same suite measures 76.5% branches on g++ 11.4 (the documented WSL2 host) and 81.5% on CI's ubuntu-24.04 g++. Lines barely move. The floor is set to hold on the oldest compiler in use, so CI carries ~5pp of slack — the alternative, pinning CI to its own higher number, would make a local `make coverage` pass while CI fails.

### Rust

The CI gate is `cargo cov-ci` (alias defined in `rust/.cargo/config.toml`) which fails if line OR region coverage falls below the floors (currently 87 line / 86 region). After the gate passes, CI runs `cargo cov-lcov` and uploads `lcov.info` as the `rust-lcov` artifact.

```bash
cd rust
cargo cov-ci         # what CI runs
cargo cov            # interactive HTML report
cargo cov-lcov       # lcov.info for IDE coverage overlays
```

### Python

The CI gate runs `poetry -C python run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing`. Configuration lives in `python/pyproject.toml` under `[tool.coverage.run]` (source set, branch tracking, exclusions) and `[tool.coverage.report]`. The floor is `fail_under = 92` (combined line+branch) in `[tool.coverage.report]` — the single source of truth, so a bare `pytest --cov` enforces it without a CLI flag. `__main__.py` is excluded because it's the `python -m mie_decoder` entry shim (parallel to Rust's `bin/mie-decoder.rs` exclusion).

```bash
# What CI runs (use this before pushing)
poetry -C python run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing

# HTML report (opens in browser; written to htmlcov/)
poetry -C python run pytest --cov --cov-report=html
```

### C++

The CI gate is `make -C cpp coverage`, the same target a developer runs. It
rebuilds from clean with `--coverage` at `-O0` (optimisation reorders and merges
basic blocks, so branch counts would describe the optimised control flow rather
than the source), runs the **full** Catch2 suite, then gates with `gcovr` on
`COVERAGE_MIN_LINE` and `COVERAGE_MIN_BRANCH` from the Makefile.

```bash
cd cpp
make coverage          # what CI runs: measure and gate
make coverage-report   # same measurement, no gate, with per-branch detail
```

Two files are excluded, both deliberately. `src/main.cpp` is the executable
entry point and nothing else — its body is three calls, and the Rust gate
ignores its own `bin/mie-decoder.rs` for the same reason, which keeps the two
numbers comparable. `src/platform_win32.cpp` is not compiled on Linux so gcov
never sees it; it is named in the exclusion list anyway, so that the omission is
a stated fact rather than an accident of which host ran the build. It is covered
by the MSVC tier, which has **no** coverage measurement — a real gap this gate
does not close.

### Ratcheting the floor

When coverage is consistently above the floor by >2pp, bump it. For Rust, edit the `cov-ci` alias in `rust/.cargo/config.toml`. For Python, edit `fail_under` in `python/pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.coverage.report]` block (the CI job has no `--cov-fail-under` flag — the config value is authoritative). For C++, edit `COVERAGE_MIN_LINE` / `COVERAGE_MIN_BRANCH` in `cpp/Makefile`. Update the rationale comment in each file when you do.

**The C++ branch floor is the one that needs work, not just a bump.** CI measures 81.5% and the WSL2 host 76.5%; either way it is several hundred uncovered branch outcomes short of the 90% the other columns reach, concentrated in `reader.cpp`, `writer.cpp` and `merge.cpp`. The floor sits at the lower, portable figure so nothing regresses on any supported compiler — not because 76% is the intended destination. Raise it toward CI's number once the spread is understood, and toward 90% once the tests exist.

---

## 11. Releasing

### Rust crate

```bash
cd rust
cargo build --release
```

The resulting binary at `rust/target/release/mie-decoder` is the deliverable artifact.

### Python package

```bash
poetry -C python check --strict --lock
poetry -P python build   # -P (not -C): -C doubles the src path on Windows; -P needs Poetry >= 2.0
```

This produces `python/dist/mie_decoder-<version>.tar.gz` and `mie_decoder-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`.

### Version coordination

**v1.0.0 is a joint release** — both implementations ship together at v1.0.0 from a single repository tag (`v1.0.0`). Subsequent releases may diverge in version, but the cross-implementation conformance contract (CSV byte-for-byte equivalence on shared behavior) holds at any compatible version pair.

Tagging scheme:

- **`v1.0.0`** — single tag for the v1.0.0 joint cut. Used because both impls ship simultaneously from one commit.
- **`rust-vX.Y.Z` / `python-vX.Y.Z`** — impl-prefixed tags for future divergent releases. Avoid SemVer-style suffix tags like `v1.0.0-rust` because the hyphen marks a pre-release identifier and tools treat such tags as *less than* `v1.0.0`.

Bump versions when:

- **Rust (`rust/Cargo.toml`)** — any change to the public crate API, the CLI surface, or the on-disk output.
- **Python (`python/pyproject.toml` only)** — same axes for the Python package. `python/src/mie_decoder/__init__.py::__version__` reads from package metadata via `importlib.metadata.version("mie-decoder")`, so `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth — no second file to keep in lockstep. `poetry check --strict --lock` catches `pyproject.toml`/`poetry.lock` drift in CI.

### CHANGELOG discipline

`CHANGELOG.md` follows the [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. The convention:

- **Every commit that introduces a user- or maintainer-visible change adds an entry under `[Unreleased]` in the same commit.** This includes feature additions, behavior changes, bug fixes, error-message changes, exit-code changes, conformance-suite changes that affect the contract, and tooling changes that affect the developer workflow (e.g. new pre-commit hook steps, new CI jobs). Pure internal refactors with zero observable change can be skipped.
- Use the standard categories: `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Deprecated`, `### Removed`, `### Fixed`, `### Security`. A custom `### Maintenance` subsection is acceptable for genuinely-maintenance entries (e.g. stale doc count updates) that don't fit the standard categories.
- Write entries in the imperative voice describing the *outcome*, not the implementation steps. The git history captures the steps; the CHANGELOG captures the contract.
- At release cut: rename `[Unreleased]` to `[<version>] — YYYY-MM-DD`, leave a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` above it, and update the compare-URL footer.

### Version bump checklist

The version bump itself rolls up the accumulated `[Unreleased]` entries into a dated release section. Bump in the same commit that:

1. Renames `[Unreleased]` to `[<version>] — YYYY-MM-DD` in `CHANGELOG.md` and seeds a new empty `[Unreleased]` section.
2. Updates the compare-URL footer (`[<version>]: .../compare/<previous>...<version>`) — see the warning below; this is the step most often missed.
3. Updates the version in **all five places**, because a joint cut ships one number from one tag:
   `rust/Cargo.toml`, `rust/Cargo.lock` (the `mie-decoder` entry — a `cargo build` refreshes it),
   `python/pyproject.toml`, `cpp/src/cli.cpp` (`kVersion`, which is what `--version` prints), and
   `cpp/CMakeLists.txt` (`project(... VERSION ...)`).

   > This step named only the first three until v2.13.0. The C++ implementation was added after
   > the checklist was written and nobody came back to it, so `mie-decoder --version` could have
   > reported a different number depending on which implementation an operator ran.
   > `repo-hygiene.sh` now fails when the five disagree, so the checklist and the gate say the
   > same thing.
4. Updates any per-version doc references (e.g. "X-test suite (as of vN.M.0)" in MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md §10).

> **Watch the footer (step 2).** This step was silently skipped on the `1.4.0` and `1.4.1` cuts: the body sections were dated correctly but the footer's `[Unreleased]` link was left pointing at `v1.3.0...HEAD` and no `[1.4.0]`/`[1.4.1]` entries were added. It was repaired during the `1.5.0` cut. The body roll-up (step 1) is visible in the rendered changelog so it's hard to forget; the footer is easy to miss because nothing breaks without it. When cutting, after editing, confirm the footer's `[Unreleased]` line points at the *new* version (`compare/v<new>...HEAD`) and that every released version since the last footer update has its own `compare/<prev>...<this>` line — `git tag --sort=-creatordate` is the cross-check.

The CHANGELOG entry, the version bump, and any user-visible behavior changes all land together so a tag points at a coherent unit of release.

---

## 12. Cross-implementation alignment principles

These are the operating rules that keep the two crates from drifting:

1. **Spec first.** New behavior lands as an L2 / L3 requirement before code. Both implementations then satisfy it.
2. **Conformance fixtures for cross-impl behavior.** Anything that affects CSV output or exit codes belongs in `tests/conformance/`.
3. **Per-impl detail goes in L3.** Python-specific constraints (stdlib `csv`, tomllib, Poetry) live as `L3-PY-*`. Rust-specific constraints (memmap2, BufWriter) live as `L3-RS-*`. The shared L2 stays implementation-agnostic.
4. **Error variants ship together.** When you add a new variant in one language, add it in the other in the same PR.
5. **Log message wording can drift.** Operators read CSV output and exit codes; log message text isn't part of the contract. Don't over-coordinate it.
6. **CLI capability parity is the contract** (per L1-CLI-001) — capability parity matters, exact spelling doesn't. Today the two CLIs share one identical argument surface: the same subcommands (`decode` / `count` / `dump`), the same `--separate-errors` flag, the same global `--config`, and the same comma-separated filter syntax. They are free to diverge in spelling so long as capability parity holds.
7. **`memmap2` is the only Rust runtime dep.** Argument parsing, CSV writing, TOML loading, logging, and error types are all hand-rolled. Adding a crate requires explicit justification — see `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `CLAUDE.md` "Conventions worth preserving".
