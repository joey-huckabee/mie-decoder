# MIE-Decoder Roadmap

> **This roadmap is forward-looking only.** Completed work is not tracked here —
> it lives in `CHANGELOG.md` (release history), `docs/L1-REQ.md` /
> `docs/L2-REQ.md` / `docs/L3-REQ.md` (the normative requirements), and
> `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md` (verification status), all backed by git history.
>
> **Do not mint requirement IDs (`L2-*`, `L3-*`) in this file.** An ID is born
> only when its requirement is written in `docs/L2-REQ.md` / `docs/L3-REQ.md`;
> describe intended work in prose and let the requirement process own the IDs.
> The former "Team Review Backlog", "Production-Readiness Audit", "Architecture
> Audit", and "Documentation Initiative" sections — all describing shipped work —
> were removed on 2026-07-07 for exactly this reason: provisional IDs minted here
> had begun to collide with real assignments (e.g. this file proposed
> `L2-CONF-006` for a conformance case while `docs/L2-REQ.md` had since assigned
> `L2-CONF-006` to the public-library-API requirement).

## Queued for the next release (`[Unreleased]`)

`[Unreleased]` is emptied at each release cut; whatever sits above the
most recent dated section in `CHANGELOG.md` is the live queue. Future work
accumulates here; when ready to cut a release, follow the version-bump
checklist in `docs/MAINTAINER-GUIDE.md` section 11.

## Planned

| Version | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| 3.0 | Data word decoders, additional per-message-type CSVs. |
| 4.0 | Apache Parquet output. |

## Merge follow-ups

The multi-file time-sorted merge has shipped (see `CHANGELOG.md`); the items
below are candidate refinements on top of it, **none built yet**. The first two
groups are next-release candidates (investigate-then-schedule); `--order file`
is distant-future. None has a committed version.

**Recorder-identity-aware merge.** The `MUX` column is already populated from a
configurable filename field (delimiter + 0-based index). Two related ideas could
reuse that same parsed identity:

- **Per-recorder DELTA.** DELTA is computed on the merged *global* timeline, so
  it does not reflect any single recorder's true inter-arrival cadence when more
  than one recorder contributes the same RT/SA key. A future release could key
  DELTA on the parsed recorder identity, falling back to the global timeline for
  inputs whose name cannot be parsed.
- **Identity-based merge tiebreak.** The equal-timestamp tiebreak keys on
  `(microseconds, file_index, within-file sequence)`, where `file_index` is the
  input's position in the resolved list — not the parsed identity. A future
  release could break ties by the parsed recorder identity instead.
- **Optional `TERM_NAME` from the filename** — the same delimiter+index
  mechanism (a second configurable field) could populate the still-empty
  `TERM_NAME` column, if a terminal-name field is encoded in the name.
- **Richer locator** — if delimiter+index proves insufficient for some naming
  scheme, a hand-rolled wildcard locator (reusing the `--glob` matcher) could be
  added without a new dependency.

**Cross-recorder de-duplication refinements.** Collapsing duplicate transactions
seen by multiple recorders already ships behind `--collapse-duplicates` /
`[merge] collapse_duplicates` (off by default, loss-free; window via
`--collapse-window-us`). Possible follow-ups, none built:

- **Witness annotation** — an optional column recording how many / which
  recorders saw a collapsed event (changes the CSV schema, so it would be its
  own opt-in).
- **Clock-skew alignment** — estimate / correct a per-recorder time offset
  rather than relying on a fixed `--collapse-window-us` tolerance.
- **Survivor-selection policy** — prefer the cleanest copy (e.g. the non-error
  read) rather than always keeping the first in heap order.
- **Deduped `count`** — collapsing applies to the `decode` CSV path today; a
  deduped `count` mode could follow.

**`--order file` (non-time merge).** A distant-future opt-in that would
concatenate inputs in CLI/manifest order **without** time-sorting, for sets that
are not calendar-locked IRIG (Standard counters, freerun, or mixed-format).
Today such sets are hard-rejected (exit 6) because they cannot share an absolute
timeline; `--order file` would let an operator explicitly accept a non-time
ordering. It is gated behind an explicit flag precisely so the default can never
silently emit a misleadingly "sorted" CSV — the operator must opt out of the
time guarantee. Output rows would carry their source-file order; DELTA would be
per file (no global timeline exists in this mode). Not scheduled; recorded here
so the request isn't folded into the time-merge contract without separate design.

## Decode correctness

- **IRIG day-field decoding across DDC card models.** Known limitation in
  v1.0.0 (carried from Python). The bit layout for the day-of-year field
  appears to vary between firmware versions; needs reverse-engineering
  across a sample set with cross-references against vendor CSV.
  - **Status: blocked on external data** — cannot proceed without real
    sample recordings. The v1.5.0 PRA-9 work only made the discrepancy
    *visible* (a one-time advisory WARN); the actual decode fix is deferred
    until ground-truth data is available.
  - **What's known.** The decoder extracts day-of-year as a 9-bit binary
    integer from Upper-Word bits 13–5 (`(upper >> 5) & 0x1FF`), which is
    correct per the DDC specification. Hour, minute, second, microsecond,
    and the freerun bit all decode correctly and match vendor CSV on every
    observed card model. Only the day-of-year field diverges, and only on
    *some* models — suggesting the firmware encodes that field differently
    (leading hypotheses: BCD rather than binary, or a different field width
    / bit offset). Freerun recordings are unaffected (the field carries no
    calendar meaning when the internal oscillator is running).
  - **What we need to collect** (the external dependency): for each of
    several DDC card models / firmware revisions — (1) a real `.mie`
    recording, (2) the vendor-generated CSV for that *same* file (the
    oracle), and (3) the known real calendar date the recording was made.
    A model/firmware identifier per sample is needed to tell a per-model
    encoding from a universal mis-slice.
  - **What we're looking for / method.** For each sample, pull the raw
    16-bit Upper Word and tabulate decoded-day vs vendor-day vs true-day.
    Solve for the transform that maps our value to the vendor's
    (BCD-decode of the bits? a shifted/widened bit window? an offset?), and
    determine whether it correlates with card model/firmware. Outcome:
    either a single corrected extraction or a model-keyed decode, landed as
    a spec'd requirement with byte-exact conformance fixtures so output
    matches vendor CSV. Until then the advisory WARN stays.

- **`L2-DEC-012` tie-break conformance test.** The IRIG-wins-on-tie tie-break
  (`L2-DEC-012`) is specified and implemented, but is still listed as Draft in
  `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`: constructing an input that yields a genuine
  equal-score IRIG/Standard detection tie requires reverse-engineering the
  auto-detection heuristic. Deferred until a crafted fixture can force the tie.

## Shared Commitments

- **`config/default.toml` and TOML config support remain a first-class feature.** The Rust build ships a hand-rolled TOML loader for our config schema; the file format and key names are stable.
- **CSV column layout matches DDC vendor output byte-for-byte.** No reordering or renaming of columns, including the vendor placeholder columns (`MUX`, `TERM_NAME`, `IM_GAP`, `RCV_GAP`, `XMT_GAP`). `TERM_NAME`/`IM_GAP`/`RCV_GAP`/`XMT_GAP` remain empty. As of L2-WRT-020 the `MUX` *cell* is populated from the input file name by default (its column position is unchanged); `--no-mux` / `[mux] enabled = false` restores empty MUX for a byte-for-byte vendor diff.
- **Sync recovery semantics preserved.** N-record look-ahead (default `N = 2` per L2-SYN-005, configurable via L2-SYN-026), 64 KB scan cap, error records and SPURIOUS_DATA continuations remain valid records that pass validation.
- **One validation implementation.** Header skip, normal forward decode, and post-loss recovery share the same validation rules through the boolean compatibility wrapper or the detailed failure API. There is no weaker fast path.
- **Cross-implementation conformance.** Text-based fixtures under
  `tests/conformance/` exercise shared decoding, recovery, filtering, config,
  error, and CSV behavior against byte-exact output oracles in CI.

## Out of Scope (Pinned)

### IRIG 106 1553 decode support is out of scope for MIE Decoder

See `docs/L1-REQ.md` NR-001. MIE files use a DDC proprietary
record format that is distinct from IRIG 106 Chapter 10 1553 packet
formats. Adding IRIG 106 1553 decode is a new capability — separate
requirements, design analysis, architecture review, and approval —
not an incremental extension of MIE-Decoder. Any inbound feature
request that says "just add IRIG 106 support" SHALL be redirected
to a new requirements + design review.
