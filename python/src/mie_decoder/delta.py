"""Per-RT/MSG ``DELTA`` tracking — the one definition of "the same message".

Why this is its own module
--------------------------

``DELTA`` used to be computed in three places with the key spelled three ways.
:mod:`mie_decoder.reader` called ``_compute_delta`` twice: once with
``msg.delta_key`` and once with a hand-built ``f"{cmd.rt}:{cmd.subaddress}{c}"``,
because on the errored-record path the message does not exist yet.
:mod:`mie_decoder.merge` kept its own tracker, also keyed by ``msg.delta_key``.
Three spellings of one concept, and nothing asserted that the hand-built string
matched the property it was standing in for — a mismatch would have made
``DELTA`` mean one thing for clean records and another for errored ones, in the
same file, silently.

The arithmetic was duplicated with it, and had already drifted: the reader warns
once per key when a clock steps backwards, and the merge path did the same
computation silently.

This module does not log
-----------------------

:meth:`DeltaTracker.observe` returns a :class:`DeltaOutcome` describing what
happened and the caller decides whether to say anything — the same rule
:mod:`mie_decoder.sync` follows, for the same reason. A tracker cannot know
whether a backward step is worth a WARN (single-file decode: yes, once per key)
or is already reported at file granularity (a merge naming its unsorted inputs,
L2-MRG-006).

The "have I already mentioned this key" bookkeeping *is* kept here, so the
once-per-key promise has one owner rather than a set in each caller.

Mirrors ``rust/src/delta.rs`` and ``cpp/src/delta.cpp``.
