"""Multi-file, time-sorted streaming k-way merge (L1-MRG-*, L2-MRG-*).

Accepts several decoded recordings and yields one stream of ``MieMessage``s in
global time order, holding at most one record per open file in a min-heap
(resident memory O(number of files), independent of total record count —
L2-MRG-002). The merged stream feeds the existing ``write_csv`` /
``write_csv_split`` unchanged.

Merge requires every input to be calendar-locked IRIG; Standard-format,
freerun-leading, or mixed-format inputs are rejected up front
(:class:`MieIncompatibleMergeInputsError`, CLI exit 6 — L2-MRG-003). DELTA is
measured **per input file** by default — each reader already computed it for its
own file, so this module leaves it alone and a merged record's value equals its
single-file value by construction. ``--delta-scope global`` recomputes it across
the merged timeline instead (L2-MRG-005).

Mirrors ``rust/src/merge.rs``; the heap is the standard-library :mod:`heapq` and the
``--glob`` matcher is hand-rolled to the same single-directory ``*``/``?``
semantics as Rust (L3-PY-014) — no new dependency.

    survivor is kept iff ``abs(survivor_us - us) <= window_us``. That order
    independence is the requirement, not an optimisation. This used to evict only
    from the FRONT, testing the one-sided ``us - front_us``, which is correct
    only while the stream is sorted. After a lenient backward step (L2-MRG-006)
    the front can hold a timestamp in the *future* of the current record, the
