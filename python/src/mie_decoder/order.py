"""Canonical CSV row ordering (L1-OUT-003, L2-WRT-021, L2-WRT-022).

Rows leave the decoder in a canonical order: ascending ``TIME_STAMP``, then
ascending ``RT``, then ``MSG`` — subaddress ascending and, within one
subaddress, receive (``R``) before transmit (``T``). The upstream stages already
deliver ascending timestamps (a single file is in chronological capture order; a
merge is heap-ordered by absolute IRIG microseconds), so this stage is only
responsible for the **tie**: it buffers each run of consecutive records sharing
one timestamp and stable-sorts that run by ``(rt, subaddress, direction)``.

Two properties make this safe over a streaming pipeline:

- It **never reorders across a timestamp boundary**. Only a run of consecutive
  equal timestamps is permuted, so a non-monotonic input (L2-MRG-006, which
  forbids re-sorting) is left exactly as it arrived: the stream ``T, T, U, T``
  sorts the leading pair and leaves the trailing ``T`` where it is.
- Buffering is capped by ``max_group`` (L2-WRT-022). A corrupt recording whose
  timestamps all decode to one value would otherwise buffer the whole file; at
  the cap the run is emitted in arrival order with one WARN and decoding
  continues.

``SPURIOUS_DATA`` records carry no Command Word, so they have no ``RT``/``MSG``
to sort on. They are **pinned**: excluded from the permutation and kept
immediately after the record they followed on input. That preserves the
adjacency the ``0x2000`` "continuation of a preceding error" code is defined in
terms of (L2-ERR-005) — separating a spurious record from its parent error would
leave that code describing nothing.

DELTA needs no recomputation downstream of this stage: it is tracked per
``RT``/``MSG`` key, and two records in one run that share a key also share a
timestamp, so their gap is zero regardless of their relative order. The reorder
is DELTA-invariant by construction.
