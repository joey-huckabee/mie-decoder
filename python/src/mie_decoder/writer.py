"""CSV output writer for decoded MIE messages.

Streams rows straight to the output handle through the standard-library
``csv`` module — no DataFrame or full-file buffering, so decode memory is
O(1) in the record count (L3-PY-012). Produces CSV output matching the
column layout used by DDC's recording software, enabling direct
comparison between MIE-Decoder output and vendor-generated CSV files.

Output Column Definitions:

    TIME_STAMP
        IRIG-format timestamp of the first word of this message on the
        1553 bus, formatted as ``DAY:HH:MM:SS.uuuuuu``. The DAY field
        is the day-of-year (1–366). Hours, minutes, and seconds are
        zero-padded to two digits. Microseconds are zero-padded to six
        digits, giving microsecond-level resolution.

    RT
        Remote Terminal address (0–30). Identifies which RT participated
        in this bus transaction. Address 31 is reserved for broadcast.

    MSG
        Message identifier combining the subaddress and transfer
        direction in the format ``<Subaddress><T|R>``. For example,
        ``11R`` means Subaddress 11, Receive (BC→RT); ``22T`` means
        Subaddress 22, Transmit (RT→BC). Subaddresses 0 and 31 denote
        mode code messages per MIL-STD-1553B.

    WD01 through WD32
        Raw 16-bit data words in uppercase hexadecimal (e.g., ``0400``,
        ``CA22``). Words are in bus wire order. Columns beyond the
        actual data word count for this message are empty strings.
        The maximum is 32 data words per MIL-STD-1553B.

    STAT
        Raw 16-bit MIL-STD-1553 Status Word in uppercase hexadecimal.
        Returned by the RT to indicate message acceptance, busy status,
        subsystem flag, etc. Bits 15–11 echo the RT address.

    CMD
        Raw 16-bit MIL-STD-1553 Command Word in uppercase hexadecimal.
        Sent by the Bus Controller to initiate the transaction. Contains
        the RT address, T/R bit, subaddress, and word count.

    MUX
        Multiplexer label / source identifier. Not decoded from the binary
        record: by default it is derived from a field of the input **file
        name** (L2-WRT-020) so a decoded CSV carries the recorder identity
        encoded in the name. Emitted empty when MUX population is disabled
        (``--no-mux`` / ``[mux] enabled = false``, which restores the
        vendor-exact layout) or when the configured field is absent.

    TERM_NAME
        Terminal or equipment name associated with the RT/SA combination.
        Derived from external configuration; not decoded, so emitted as
        an empty column to preserve the vendor CSV layout (L2-WRT-013).

    BUS
        Redundant bus identifier: ``A`` or ``B``. MIL-STD-1553 defines
        two redundant buses for fault tolerance; this field indicates
        which bus the message was captured on.

    DELTA
        Inter-arrival time in seconds (six decimal places) between this
        message and the most recent prior message sharing the same
        Remote Terminal address (RT) and message identifier (MSG).

        The MSG identifier is the combination of Subaddress and Direction
        (e.g., ``11T`` for Subaddress 11, Transmit; ``22R`` for
        Subaddress 22, Receive). Messages are grouped by the composite
        key ``<RT>:<MSG>`` — for example, all messages to RT 15 SA 11
        Receive are tracked independently from RT 15 SA 11 Transmit,
        and independently from RT 30 SA 11 Receive.

        For the first occurrence of any RT/MSG combination in a
        recording file, DELTA is ``0.000000``.

        This metric directly reveals the Bus Controller's scheduling
        rate for each unique message type. A consistent DELTA of
        approximately 0.016 seconds indicates the BC is polling that
        message at a 60 Hz minor frame rate. A consistent DELTA of
        approximately 0.033 seconds indicates a 30 Hz rate. Jitter or
        drift in DELTA values across a recording can indicate bus
        loading anomalies, missed scheduling cycles, BC priority
        changes, or intermittent RT response failures.

    IM_GAP
        Inter-message gap. Not decoded from the binary record; emitted as
        an empty column to preserve the vendor CSV layout (L2-WRT-013).

    RCV_GAP
        Receive gap. Not decoded from the binary record; emitted as an
        empty column to preserve the vendor CSV layout (L2-WRT-013).

    XMT_GAP
        Transmit gap. Not decoded from the binary record; emitted as an
        empty column to preserve the vendor CSV layout (L2-WRT-013).

# ── Broken-pipe classification (L2-WRT-018) ────────────────────────────

#: ``errno`` values that mean "the downstream consumer closed the pipe" on
#: Windows. POSIX surfaces this as ``EPIPE``, which CPython raises as a
#: ``BrokenPipeError``; Windows does **not** — writing to a pipe whose read end
#: has closed comes out of the text layer as a plain ``OSError`` with ``EINVAL``
#: (22), occasionally ``EPIPE`` (32). A bare ``except BrokenPipeError`` therefore
#: never fires there, which made ``mie-decoder decode rec.mie | head`` exit 1
#: with an error on Windows while the Rust CLI exited 0.

    already normalizes across platforms. Python has no such normalization, so the
    Windows ``errno`` values are matched explicitly (see
    :data:`_WINDOWS_BROKEN_PIPE_ERRNOS`).

    The extra ``errno`` matching is deliberately scoped to Windows: on POSIX,
