"""Shared machinery for the L1-ROB-001 fuzz harnesses.

Every fuzz harness in this tree draws from the same generator as the Rust and
C++ ones -- same xorshift64, same seed, same draw order -- and reports through
the same ``FUZZ-SUMMARY`` line. That is the whole point: three implementations
proving "I did not crash" in three different shapes cannot be compared, and a
shared generator is wasted if the harnesses do not also agree on what they
count.

It lives in its own module rather than on a test class because the harnesses are
spread across files: the reader and dump harnesses are in ``test_e2e.py``, the
merge input-resolution harness is in ``test_merge.py``, and duplicating the
generator between them is exactly how the merge harness came to use
``random.Random`` and see different inputs from every other harness in the
project.

See ``docs/FUZZING.md`` for the map of what is fuzzed and what is not.

Shared verbatim with ``rust/tests/integration.rs`` and ``cpp/tests/test_fuzz.cpp``.

A pattern built by lossily UTF-8-decoding random bytes would be the obvious
thing, and it is wrong twice over. Random bytes almost never contain ``*`` or
``?``, so the matcher's interesting branches are never reached; and the three
languages' lossy decoders do not agree character-for-character on how many
U+FFFD an invalid sequence produces, so the counters could diverge without the
glob matchers disagreeing about anything.

``*`` and ``?`` are weighted (three and two slots) because the first version of
this harness drew uniformly over patterns up to 95 characters long and matched a
probe *zero* times in 512 iterations -- it fuzzed the reject path and nothing
else. The last two entries are deliberately non-ASCII: Rust and Python match
over scalar values and the C++ matcher advances ``?`` by a whole UTF-8
character, and this is the surface where that agreement is either real or it is
not.
