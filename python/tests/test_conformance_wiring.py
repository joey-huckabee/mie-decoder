"""Meta-tests that the cross-implementation conformance suite is wired up.

L2-CONF-003 ("each implementation's output SHALL match the checked-in CSV
oracle") is verified by `tests/conformance/run.py`, which is invoked by
the CI ``conformance`` job. The runner is not itself a pytest test and
therefore can't carry a ``@pytest.mark.requirement`` marker; these
pytest meta-tests assert that the conformance contract is present,
discoverable, and exercises at least one fixture so the trace matrix
credits L2-CONF-003 with a verifiable artifact.

A failing run of the conformance runner in CI is the authoritative
test; these meta-tests guarantee the runner stays wired up.
