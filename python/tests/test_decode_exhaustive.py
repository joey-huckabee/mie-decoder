"""EXHAUSTIVE verification of the word decoders against the Rust implementation.

The per-case tests in ``test_decode.py`` check the values a human thought to
check. These check ALL of them: every one of the 65 536 possible Type Words,
every one of the 65 536 possible Command Words, and every bit position of every
IRIG and Standard timestamp field. There is no corner case left for a reviewer
to have missed, because no case is selected.

HOW IT WORKS

``rust/examples/decode_digest.rs`` sweeps the same inputs through the *Rust*
decoders and prints an FNV-1a digest of the decoded fields. The constants below
are those digests -- the same four numbers ``cpp/tests/test_decode_exhaustive.cpp``
pins. This file recomputes them from the Python decoders, so a single differing
field in any of ~390 000 decodes changes the digest and fails the test.

Regenerate after an intentional wire-format change::

    cd rust && cargo run --release --example decode_digest

A changed digest means the RUST decoder changed. That is a different problem
from the Python one drifting, and the fix is different too -- check which side
moved before editing anything here.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The C++ tree has had this check since it joined the
joint cut; Python did not, so the strongest cross-implementation check in the
project covered two decoders out of three. That is a parity gap of exactly the
kind ``docs/FUZZING.md`` exists to track, and closing it is why this file is
here.

WHY THE DISCRIMINATION TESTS BELOW MATTER

A digest test that cannot fail is worse than no test: it reports success
forever. Every digest here is therefore accompanied by a case that feeds a
deliberately-wrong decoding through the same hash and asserts the result
differs. Without those, a bug in the hash -- or a hash that ignored its input --
would make this whole file a very convincing no-op.
