"""Byte-exact characterization guard for the CSV writer (PY-streaming).

These tests freeze the writer's current observable output as golden
fixtures so the PY-streaming refactor — which replaces the full-pandas-
DataFrame buffering with a constant-memory streaming writer — cannot
change a single output byte. They are deliberately end-to-end (real
``MieFileReader`` → real writer) and compare raw bytes, not parsed CSV,
so quoting, line terminators, padding, and trailing empty cells are all
pinned.

The golden fixtures under ``tests/golden/py_streaming/`` were generated
from the pre-refactor (pandas) writer. If a future change legitimately
alters output, regenerate them deliberately and review the diff against
the Rust writer and the cross-impl conformance oracles — never silently.

The representative stream exercises every distinct row shape the writer
emits:

* normal records with a full 30-data-word payload,
* DELTA progression (first occurrence ``0.000000`` → steady ``0.016000``),
* an errored record (Type Word bit 14: truncated payload, ``ERROR``/code),
* a SPURIOUS_DATA continuation (``SPURIOUS``/``2000`` — proving the
  reader's ``prev_was_error`` classification survives into the CSV),
* and the split-mode partition (normal rows vs errored/spurious rows).
