"""Constant-memory verification for the streaming writer (L3-PY-012).

Proves Python decode memory is O(1) in the record count — the property
PY-streaming exists to deliver — by measuring the ``tracemalloc`` peak
while writing a small vs. a large record stream and asserting it stays
essentially flat. Under the old full-``DataFrame`` writer the peak grew
linearly (~100x more records → ~100x peak); a regression that
reintroduces row buffering would blow the ratio bound and fail here.

The input is a lazy generator (not a materialized list, which would
itself be O(record_count) and mask the writer's behavior), and the
destination is a real file (a ``StringIO`` would accumulate the whole
CSV in memory and defeat the measurement).
