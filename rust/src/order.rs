//! Canonical CSV row ordering (L1-OUT-003, L2-WRT-021, L2-WRT-022).
//!
//! Rows leave the decoder in a canonical order: ascending `TIME_STAMP`, then
//! ascending `RT`, then `MSG` — subaddress ascending and, within one
//! subaddress, receive (`R`) before transmit (`T`). The upstream stages already
//! deliver ascending timestamps (a single file is in chronological capture
//! order; a merge is heap-ordered by absolute IRIG microseconds), so this stage
//! is only responsible for the **tie**: it buffers each run of consecutive
//! records sharing one timestamp and stable-sorts that run by `(RT, subaddress,
//! direction)`.
//!
//! Two properties make this safe to run over a streaming pipeline:
//!
//! - It **never reorders across a timestamp boundary**. Only a run of
//!   consecutive equal timestamps is permuted, so a non-monotonic input
//!   (L2-MRG-006, which forbids re-sorting) is left exactly as it arrived: the
//!   stream `T, T, U, T` sorts the leading pair and leaves the trailing `T`
//!   where it is.
//! - Buffering is capped by `max_group` (L2-WRT-022). A corrupt recording whose
//!   timestamps all decode to one value would otherwise buffer the whole file;
//!   at the cap the run is flushed in arrival order with one WARN and decoding
//!   continues.
//!
//! `SPURIOUS_DATA` records carry no Command Word, so they have no `RT`/`MSG` to
//! sort on. They are **pinned**: excluded from the permutation and re-emitted at
//! their original offset within the run. That preserves the adjacency the
//! `0x2000` "continuation of a preceding error" code is defined in terms of
//! (L2-ERR-005) — separating a spurious record from its parent error would leave
//! that code describing nothing.
//!
//! DELTA needs no recomputation downstream of this stage: it is tracked per
//! `RT`/`MSG` key, and two records in one run that share a key also share a
//! timestamp, so their gap is zero regardless of their relative order. The
//! reorder is DELTA-invariant by construction.
