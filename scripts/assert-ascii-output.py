"""Assert that no shipped string literal can put a non-ASCII byte on a stream.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS
--------------------

L2-CLI-014 originally required ASCII only of stdout *payloads* -- the ``dump``
report, the ``count`` integer, CSV -- on the reasoning that a payload is piped
and diffed while stderr prose is merely read by a human. The carve-out did not
survive contact with a Windows console.

Windows consoles do not default to UTF-8. A stock ``cmd.exe`` or conhost session
runs at the OEM code page, 437 in a US install, and every implementation writes
UTF-8 bytes unconditionally. An em dash is three bytes, ``e2 80 94``, which
CP437 draws as three unrelated glyphs::

    mie-decoder --- DDC MIL-STD-1553 MIE binary decoder     (intended)
    mie-decoder GCo DDC MIL-STD-1553 MIE binary decoder     (rendered, roughly)

That is the whole of the "garbage characters" an operator reports, and it looks
exactly like memory corruption to anyone who has not counted the bytes. Prose is
therefore subject to the same rule as payload, and L2-CLI-014 now says so.

The fix is ASCII at the source rather than a console call. ``SetConsoleOutputCP``
would mean new OS surface in a platform layer deliberately confined to five
concerns (``scripts/assert-platform-confined.sh``), a process-global state
change, and no help at all when stderr is redirected to a file that some later
tool reads at the code page. Rust and Python would each need their own
equivalent. ASCII needs none of that and cannot regress per-platform.

WHAT IS SCANNED
---------------

Shipped sources only -- ``cpp/src``, ``cpp/include``, ``rust/src``,
``python/src`` -- and within them only **string literals**. Comments and doc
comments are free to use whatever punctuation reads best; they are never
written to a stream.

The separate test trees (``cpp/tests``, ``rust/tests``, ``python/tests``) are
NOT scanned. Those suites legitimately construct non-ASCII strings in order to
prove the decoder handles them -- most visibly the UTF-8 filename cases behind
the ``?`` glob rule, where a two-byte and a four-byte character are the point of
the test.

Rust is the one exception, and it is deliberate rather than overlooked: Rust
unit tests live in ``#[cfg(test)]`` modules *inside* ``src/``, so their literals
are scanned too. Excluding them would mean tracking module attributes through
the scanner for no benefit -- an assertion message is printed only when a test
fails, and holding those to ASCII costs nothing. A Rust test that genuinely
needs a non-ASCII string should build it from an escape in a ``char`` or from
``char::from_u32``, or live in ``rust/tests/``.

Both spellings of a non-ASCII character are caught, because they are equally
capable of reaching a console and only one of them is greppable:

* a raw byte >= 0x80 sitting in the literal, and
* an escape that denotes one -- ``\\xE2``, ``\\u2014``, ``\\u{2014}``,
  ``\\N{EM DASH}``, or an octal ``\\342``.

C++ is the reason the escape half exists. ``cpp/src/cli.cpp`` spelled its help
banner ``"mie-decoder \\xE2\\x80\\x94 DDC ..."``, which is pure ASCII on disk and
an em dash on the wire, so a byte-level scan of the tree reported it clean while
the console showed mojibake.

Run standalone, or via ``scripts/repo-hygiene.sh``.

Exit 0 when clean, 1 when a violation is found.
