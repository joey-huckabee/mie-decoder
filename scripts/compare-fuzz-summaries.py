"""Compare the FUZZ-SUMMARY lines emitted by every fuzz burn-in job.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The three L1-ROB-001 byte harnesses share a generator -- same
xorshift64, same seed, same size bands, same draw order -- so iteration N is the
same bytes in Rust, Python and C++. What they did NOT share was an assertion:
each one proved, in its own process and its own test framework, that it did not
crash. Three implementations can each survive the same input while decoding it
differently, and nothing noticed.

Each harness now ends by writing one line of counters that are defined to mean
the same thing everywhere. This script is the part that actually compares them.
It is not a replacement for a real differential driver over the decoded CSV
(docs/FUZZING.md 6.1); it is the cheap precursor, and it is what turns "three
implementations each survived" into "three implementations agreed".

ALL-PAIRS, NOT MAJORITY -- the same rule, and the same reasoning, as
tests/conformance/differential.py: two implementations sharing a bug would
outvote the correct one, and nominating a reference would make its quirks
normative. The report names the split without naming a winner.

WHAT IS COMPARED. Every field of the line except `impl`. That means the counters
have to be path-independent by construction: the three harnesses name their temp
files differently, so anything derived from a path measures the harness rather
than the decoder. (The dump harness counts output LINES for exactly this reason
-- it counted bytes first, and the two implementations disagreed by a constant
offset that turned out to be the length of the file path in the dump header.)

A HARNESS PRESENT IN SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS AND NOT OTHERS IS REPORTED, NOT
FAILED. C++ has no `dump` harness yet; that is a known parity gap, tracked in
docs/FUZZING.md section 5, and failing the nightly on it would just make the job
permanently red and therefore ignored. A DIVERGENCE fails; a GAP is announced.

Usage:  compare-fuzz-summaries.py <artifacts-dir>

The directory is expected to hold one subdirectory per job, named
`fuzz-summary-<impl>-<os>`; the subdirectory name is used as the origin label so
the report can say *which runner* disagreed, not just which implementation.
