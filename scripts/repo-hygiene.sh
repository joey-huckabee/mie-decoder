# scripts/repo-hygiene.sh — the CI backstop for the pre-commit hook's
# file-level checks.
#
# `.githooks/pre-commit` inspects *staged blobs*, which makes it fast but also
# skippable: `git commit --no-verify` bypasses every one of its checks. Until
# v2.12.0 nothing in CI re-ran them, so CONTRIBUTING.md's "CI runs the same
# checks and will fail the merge anyway" was untrue for most of the list — a
# CRLF file, a stray `dbg!()`, a merge marker, an oversized blob or a committed
# `*.mie` recording could all land unnoticed.
#
# This script re-runs those checks over the whole *tracked tree* rather than a
# diff, so it catches anything already committed, however it got there. The
# hook stays staged-based (it must be fast); this is the safety net.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/repo-hygiene.sh
# Exit:   0 all clean, 1 one or more checks failed (all are reported, not just
#         the first — a contributor should see the whole list in one run).
