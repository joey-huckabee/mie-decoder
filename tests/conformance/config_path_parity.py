"""Differential parity check for how the two CLIs handle the ``--config`` *path*.

``config_parity.py`` and ``config_fuzz.py`` both vary the config file's
**contents** and hold the two parsers to the same accept/reject class. Neither
varies the **path**, so everything the path itself decides — what counts as a
usable config file, which exit code a bad one produces, and what the operator is
told — was pinned only by per-implementation unit tests that could drift apart
without any cross-implementation check noticing.

That surface is the one documented as a promise in
``docs/CONFIG-REFERENCE.md`` §"Trust boundary": the path must resolve to a
**regular file**, a missing or unusable one is a configuration error (exit ``5``)
and never a silent fallback to defaults, and the file may live at **any readable
location** — traversal segments and absolute paths included, because a caller who
can pass ``--config`` can already read that file directly.

This module asserts the two implementations agree on all of it, and — unlike the
content corpus, which only compares accept/reject classes — compares the **exact
exit code** and requires the promised message text in both. The v2.11.0 claim
that both loaders reject a non-regular file "with identical message text" was
previously untested across implementations.

Cases that depend on platform capabilities (character devices, symlinks) skip
themselves rather than fail, and the skips are reported so a silently-shrinking
corpus is visible.

Run automatically by ``run.py`` when both implementations are under test.
