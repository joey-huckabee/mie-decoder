"""Differential parity check for what ``--glob`` actually resolves to.

L2-MRG-001 says every implementation "SHALL expand it identically", and until
v2.17.0 the only thing any test compared was the **wildcard matcher**. Each
implementation had its own unit tests for ``*`` and ``?``, all three agreed, and
all three resolved different input sets anyway — because the disagreements were
never about wildcards:

* **Directory entries.** Python and Rust filtered to files; C++ matched every
  name ``list_directory`` returned. A directory called ``archive.mie`` was an
  input on one implementation and invisible on the other two, and the one that
  took it then failed to map it — so a batch that decoded whole twice came back
  short the third time.
* **Symlinks.** Python's ``entry.is_file()`` follows them; Rust's
  ``DirEntry::file_type`` does not. A symlinked recording was kept by one and
  dropped by the other.
* **Separators.** C++ split on ``\\`` on both platforms. On POSIX a backslash is
  an ordinary filename character, so ``odd\\name*.mie`` named one file in the
  current directory to two implementations and a pattern inside a directory
  called ``odd`` to the third.

None of those is visible to a matcher test, and none is visible to a
single-implementation test either — each implementation's unit tests pin it
against its own reading, which is the thing in question when two readings
differ. So this compares the **resolved set**, across every implementation under
test, on a directory built to contain exactly the entries they disagreed about.

The set is read back through the CLI rather than through a library call, because
the CLI is the only surface all three share. ``decode --glob`` over a multi-file
merge writes one CSV whose row count is a function of how many inputs were
resolved, so a recording of a known record count per matched file turns "which
files matched" into an integer the three must agree on. (``count`` would be the
more direct spelling, but it takes a single input by design -- ``--glob`` is a
``decode`` flag.)

Cases that depend on platform capabilities (symlinks, backslash filenames) skip
themselves rather than fail, and the skips are reported so a silently-shrinking
corpus stays visible.

Run automatically by ``run.py`` when two or more implementations are under test.
