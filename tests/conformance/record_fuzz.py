"""Differential *fuzzer* for the record-stream decoders.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. The three in-process L1-ROB-001 harnesses
(`rust/tests/integration.rs`, `python/tests/test_e2e.py`,
`cpp/tests/test_fuzz.cpp`) share a generator, so iteration N is the same bytes
everywhere -- but each one only ever proves a negative about its own process:
*it did not crash*. Their ``FUZZ-SUMMARY`` lines compare run totals, which
catches a disagreement about how many records a file yields but not two
implementations decoding the same record to different values.

This module closes that gap. It generates one input, drives it through **every**
implementation's CLI, and compares the exit-code class **and the CSV bytes**
all-pairs. It is the record-stream twin of ``config_fuzz.py``, which has done
the same thing for the config parsers since v2.11.0, and it uses the same
comparator for the same reasons -- see ``differential.py``: no majority rule
(two implementations sharing a bug would outvote the correct one) and no
reference implementation (that would make one tree's quirks normative).

STRUCTURE-AWARE, NOT UNIFORM NOISE. The in-process harnesses feed uniform random
bytes, which reach the *recovery* paths densely and the *valid record* paths
almost never -- across a 25 000-iteration burn-in they never once produced
enough consecutive equal-timestamp records to reach the canonical-order stage's
cap branch, which all three harnesses' comments claimed they reached "often".
This generator instead starts from the committed conformance fixtures -- every
valid record shape the project knows about -- concatenates a few, and then
*damages* them. That reaches decode, ordering, DELTA and error-classification
paths that noise cannot, while still producing inputs no human wrote.

REPRODUCIBILITY. Deterministic by default (fixed seed, fixed iteration count),
overridable with ``MIE_RECORD_FUZZ_SEED`` / ``MIE_RECORD_FUZZ_ITERS``. On a
divergence the generated input is printed as a **hex fixture**, ready to paste
into ``tests/conformance/inputs/`` as a permanent case -- because a seed stops
reproducing anything the moment the generator changes.
